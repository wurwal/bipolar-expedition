Well, you say that, but most libraries did check the website, so all is not lost thanks to your work.  A few did order copies just based on the reviews!!!

I can only assume that they were Lex-dix-six...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thats good news about the libraries. Shame the website didn&#039;t come before it, so you could have had a link printed in it the book. Hope the crappy weather isn&#039;t affecting you too badly, and if you feel like writing any more posts ill see if I can illustrate them. Take care.
