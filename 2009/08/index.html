				<small>August 29th, 2009 <!-- by Neil --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Well this week it&#8217;s the turn of football.  I used to play it and mostly enjoyed the game, but around the early seventies things started to change and I gave up the sport when what began happening on the professional pitch spread to the game in the park, and I think it started with the referees.</p>
<p>I was brought up to respect other people and have a sense of fair play in all games, cheating wasn&#8217;t, and still isn&#8217;t, an option.  So when I was playing for a six-a-side team one afternoon and a member of the opposing team pulled my shirt I got a tad annoyed.  Then it happened again the following week and the ref did nothing about it, so I muted my dissatisfaction and still no action was taken.  I complained to my coach and he informed me that this is how the game was being played now &#8211; so I left the side and stopped playing.  And the game is even worse now.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a right bunch of namby-pamby tarts prancing around on the pitch today, and they&#8217;re all overpaid, they practise diving in the penalty area and have a month off, with full pay, when they&#8217;ve got split ends!  Forget the shirt pulling, its gone way past that now.  Cheating on a huge scale to the point where it affects the teams positions in the league, even in the world cup!  The Maradona incident, caught on film, and knob-all was done about it, even when he admitted to the handball months later &#8211; absolutely disgraceful.  No wonder the kids think it&#8217;s okay to cheat nowadays.</p>
<p>Then crowd violence escalated and away day punch ups were organised by anyone who enjoyed four hours on the piss and a fight afterwards.  The last straw for me was when people started dying at a simple game of footie.  Bloody ridiculous.  Yip, it&#8217;s all got far to silly for my liking and I don&#8217;t care what anybody says, no human being is worth 20 mill on the transfer list.  I&#8217;d go to a game now if I could afford 45 quid to get in!  Actually no I wouldn&#8217;t, it a waste of money.  And there&#8217;s no doubt about it, there&#8217;s far to much money in the game now and it&#8217;s ruin the sport as a whole.</p>
<p>So what can be done to bring the game back into some sort reality and up the moral standard in the process?  Well, for starters there should be a block ban on players having the own agents, they&#8217;re not musicians or actors, except maybe the ones that wear hairbands!  I think they could get away with not getting sick pay too, I mean, how much can you spend in one week if your stuck at home with an ingrowing toenail?  Lastly, pay the players 500 quid a week, but give the whole team 50,000 grand each if they win, that will get the little jumped up sods running about a bit, and put a halt to time wasting over night!    </p>
<p> Yeah, I hate football&#8230;  Enjoy your weekend, I&#8217;m off to watch three bouts of swan boxing!  Bipolar Bill (&#8220;,)</p>

					<p>Well bloody well then, just when you thought there couldn&#8217;t be another Jackson court case, it seems that there might be one more after all.  It&#8217;s enough to send ya bandy! </p>
<p>Michael Jackson&#8217;s ex physician, Conrad &#8216;Propofol&#8217; Murray, who is keeping God in his heart, gave what I can only describe as a farewell speech on YouTube.  Shortly after this it&#8217;s understood that LA law-enforcement officers jumped all over him and mentioned in passing that manslaughter charges, not womanslaughter charges as was first thought, would be aimed in his direction.  I think if you look closely at his video you can actually see a small case in the background, so I think he already knew he had to pack a little going-away-bag.  I&#8217;ve heard some old bollocks in my time but this mush of a video was the mushiest.  He thanked the legion of well-wishers for their supporting emails and telephone calls, and then said he was &#8216;afraid&#8217; to reply to them!  Why?  If he was that worried why didn&#8217;t he just drive round and thank them in person? </p>
<p>You wanna hear my take on the story?  Of course you do.  Well it&#8217;s obvious isn&#8217;t it, and trust me this has taken me minutes of dedicated research and nano seconds of tireless editorifying.  So far no one has work out that his nibs was costing his record company a packet, especially with a little less than four fifths of fuck all squared return in last 15 years.  &#8220;What&#8217;s the answer,&#8221; said a company account?  &#8220;Well,&#8221; came the reply from a darkened room, &#8220;He&#8217;s worth more six feet under than he is on top of it&#8230;, if you get ma drift.&#8221;  &#8220;All we gotta do is find an Oswald.&#8221;  &#8220;A what?&#8221;  &#8220;A patsy.&#8221;  &#8220;Aaah gotcha.&#8221;  &#8220;See to it will you Finklestein.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well Finklestein thought about it for a while, and his first choice was going to be the gay mafia, but changed his mind when he discovered that their idea of a &#8216;hit&#8217; was to visit the victim in the small hours and criticise their wallpaper!  Instead he chose Jackson&#8217;s doctor, so it&#8217;ll be interesting to see how long it is before the trail of Michael Jackson untimely death backtracks its way to his record company&#8230;  And while he&#8217;s got some time on his hands, some TWO MONTHS after his death, Michael Jackson will put in an appearance as a character witness!                  </p>
<p>Right, that&#8217;s that sorted out, I&#8217;m off now, I&#8217;ve got a futtock strut that needs filing down&#8230;</p>
<p>The Spaz has gone to the fridge to get a cold one&#8230;BB</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Did you ever see a television series called, The Grimley&#8217;s?  It was a comedy set on a housing estate in Dudley at the beginning of the seventies.  The heart of the show was centered around a local school where student, Gorden Grimley carried a torch for his gorgeous English teacher.  It was a superb piece of writing and it captured the essence of the era perfectly.  The cloths, the kids, the parents and the teachers, all in a well chosen cast, were cemented together by a dry, humorous and sometimes dark script which was complimented by the music of the day. </p>
<p>Noddy Holder played the headmaster, and Amanda Holden provided the eye candy playing the role of the school&#8217;s English tutor, delicately named, Miss Tittley.  Throughout the series she was wooed by the sadistic PE teacher, Doug Digby, right up until his untimely death in a javelin accident in the gym.  As I got to know the characters it wasn&#8217;t long before I recognise a similarity between the casts roles and some of my old teachers, particularly the part played by Brian Conely as Doug Digby.  Like the character in the programme, my PE teacher was a pig of a man and was built like a brick outhouse.  Unlike all of my other lessons physical education was encouraged by applying humiliation, pain or fear, and in some cases all three in the same lesson in a bid to spur on the bloaters, weaklings and the thug elements to join in.  </p>
<p>Mr Evans was an overbearing Welshman who had Gazelle like ankles, thighs like a brace of tugboats and was, at the very least, the width of a healthy Ox.  Quite why he joined a football playing school was never disclosed but I think that was the reason he used to take out his wrath on the pupils, so for him at least it seemed the perfect placement for a practising sociopath, who may have been ejected from the Welsh Guards and was unable to find a rugby playing post.</p>
<p>All we  ever seemed to do in his lesson was running.   Cross country was most popular when it rained, and in the summer we could be found circulating the track while Evens sunbathed.  At the end of each session in, how to sweat, we were, how can I put this &#8211; coaxed towards the communal showers by two verbal directives.  &#8220;SHOWERS BOYS,&#8221; was bellowed out first, followed by, &#8220;LAST WARNING,&#8221; two minutes later.  If you weren&#8217;t under, or heading towards the showers a &#8216;persuader&#8217; was employed to &#8216;encourage&#8217; you forwards, and this came in the shape of the knotted cord which was attached to his whistle and by God it stung if it made contact with your arse. </p>
<p>There were days of change to our routine over the course of the year which strangely coincided with the weeks that the education board were in the area!  At that point every piece of field equipment we had on campus came out on show, and we were let loose with long pointy sharp things, bloody great dinner plates and cannon balls, all of which apparently had to be lobbed manually!  It was a concept some of the pupils weren&#8217;t adapted for.  You knew there was going to be an element of danger surrounding these pieces of shrapnel, especially if they were handled by the planks amongst your class.  This worrying thought was back up when the most vital piece of instruction stamped on each box was, MUST BE THROWN FORWARDS! </p>
<p>Give him his dues, Evans could chuck a javelin and a discus a hell of a distance, but with his build his was much better equipped for the shot putt, and believe me, he would be the last thing you&#8217;d want to see charging at you if you were holding a rugby ball.  He chose a victim for the tutorials in all things to be thrown that afternoon, and his first choice was the speckiest swatoid in the school.  He was an absolute wonder with a writing implement and had many, many brain cells, but his eye to hand coordination left a lot to be desired.  Imagine, if you can, a javelin left in the hands of Frank Spencer!  </p>
<p>Evans gave student Yelland a few pointers in throwing the discus and then lobbed one down the field.  Mark then picked up his projectile while the class took three paces backwards.  As it happens he did okay for a first try, it didn&#8217;t go to far but at least it went in a forward direction.  Next up was the sharp stuff.  Evans pulled a javelin out of the ground and handed to a shaking Yelland.  As before Evans went first and then gave Mark a pep talk before letting him loose with this potentially dangerous piece of equipment.</p>
<p>A sweating swat stepped up to the plate and tried desperately to physic himself up for the job in hand, but he needn&#8217;t have bothered.  Evans was on hand to inspire the last few seconds of his warm up and bellowed, &#8220;Right Yelland, what&#8217;s the most critical part of throwing a javelin?&#8221;  &#8220;Err, timing sir.&#8221;   &#8220;That&#8217;s right boy, okay class stand well back, this fucker could go anywhere!&#8221;   What Evans didn&#8217;t know was the kid he&#8217;d just left in charge of the aluminium spear had been taken out of his music studies in favour of an extra physics lesson by his parents, as he had no natural sense of rhythm!</p>
<p>We all took several steps backwards.  Some, including Evans, took a few sideways just in case, and we watched as the gangly student began his run up with a spear that was trailing along the grass behind him.  Seagulls parted in the sky above him as the javelin left his hand, but no one could see which direction it was headed.  I mean, we saw it leave his grip but that was it!  We all scanned the field to see if his spear was still in the air, or had  stuck in the grass at a jaunty angle, but nothing was the worrying sight we saw. </p>
<p>Even Evans was beginning to show major signs of concern.  By pure chance I looked directly upward and against the dark clouds I could see a silvery object hurtling its way back down to earth, and standing right underneath it was the kid that threw it.  I pushed my way through a still confused crowd and knocked Mark out of the way and the javelin missed him by a split second.  I believe he was the only athlete in the history of the school to have recieved an award for throwing a javelin the highest rather than the furthest.   It makes you wonder how we survived our education&#8230; </p>
<p>Hope you all have a blindin&#8217; weekend, and let&#8217;s not  forget&#8230; </p>
<p>&#8220;Never make an important decision on an empty stomach or a full bladder.&#8221; </p>

					<p>Are you a fan of car-crash television presenters?  Specifically the ones where the hosts think that baiting a predatory animal makes great TV.  Steve Irwin got away with this cringe-worthy style for a while, and there&#8217;s another berk (Bershire Hunt) out there, a South African guy, who delights in saying, &#8220;Look at that, look at him, look how aggressive he&#8217;s getting.&#8221;  Well of course he was getting agressive, the bloody idiot had just picked it up by its tail and was shaking his hand in front of his head! </p>
<p>Enter, Timothy Treadwell.  I&#8217;d heard about this bloke, but I didn&#8217;t know anything about him until I watch a documentary about his life last week.   What a knob!  It&#8217;s no wonder he came to a grizzly end, but the real tragedy about this story was so did his girlfriend&#8230;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the person first and what shaped him.  Treadwell was born on Long Island, NY.  He was an average student in high school and was Connecticut&#8217;s star diver, but to the public he claimed he was a British orphan who was born in Australia!   He went on to described himself as an aspiring actor.  However, after failing to get the role as the waiter behind the bar in the hit American TV series, Cheers he turned to substance abuse.  He then described himself as a recovering alcoholic, drug addict, and eco-warrior.  Can you see where this is yet going chaps?   To a degree it&#8217;s as bizarre as the Michael Jackson death saga. </p>
<p>He turned his attention towards environmental film making, and picked up a girlfriend along the way, and she loved him to bits (no don&#8217;t laugh), and when he decided to live among the bears of Katmai National Park she went with him.  Which was  bit of a bastard really, because she stated somewhere along the line that she had a fear of bears and felt deeply uncomfortable in their presence.  So where did Treadwell chose to set up his campsite?  A salmon stream where bears weighing just under half a ton would come to feed on a regular basis!  Now call me stupid, but I don&#8217;t think that was his smartest career move.    </p>
<p>Anyway, he got away with it for 13 years on the trot, but God knows how, because he seemed hellbent on self destruction.   Was he on the old Persian rugs (drugs) while he was out and about with with his furry chums?  Hmmm!  Well it does seem as though he was getting a bit slapdash with his life out in the wilderness.  He accrued six violations from the National Park Service.  One citation was for storing an ice chest filled with food in his tent!  Oh dear!   Another was for using a portable generator!  Why not just buy yourself a loudhailer and shout out, &#8220;Come- an-git- it!&#8221;   The citation I was most alarmed about was the one he racked up for guiding tourists around. [Note to self: if your going to take the bears some lunch make sure you apply for a license first!]   And I don&#8217;t think it was a good idea to keep open snack packets in the tent either.  Just an observation you understand! </p>
<p>In the documentary Tim baby was, &#8216;praying for rain.&#8217;  He ranted at the sky shouting, &#8220;I want rain Jesus boy,&#8221; and eight hours later, it turned up.  &#8220;It&#8217;s a miracle,&#8221; he said.  No. no, the weather change mate!  The bloke was completely off his trolley and was a section paper short of a ward.   He slept with a toy bear.  He used to crawl, on his hands and knees, towards a female bear, with cubs, and start talking to them in a young girlie type voice.  When asked in an  interview, was he ever afraid he replied, &#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t hurt me.&#8221;  In the 85-year old history of Katmai  National Park there had been no fatalities, none, none until soppy bollocks turned up!   Why, it&#8217;s as if the animals just want to be left alone!</p>
<p>Right I&#8217;m off, I&#8217;ve got a bear baiting class at the Haringey civic centre.  Well it beats wicker work classes hands down&#8230;  BB</p>

					<p>A new post will be added on Saturday guys; I need to research some more information before I can go any further so I apologise for the delay, but I think it&#8217;ll be worth it.  I&#8217;ve heard about the person I&#8217;m going to write about before, and last week I watch a documentary about his life to make sure I had some facts straight.  Oh dear oh dear&#8230; it really does seems that there are more out than in, in the mental health sense.</p>
<p>In the meantime Greenland needs your help.   As I mentioned last week they are a bit short in the ice department due to global warming, so here&#8217;s how you can help.  You have two main options.  Option 1 (for large companies only) : adopt a freezer for a kipper a week.  We will send you photo&#8217;s of your freezer and you&#8217;ll receive a letter once a month tracking its progress.  Option 2 :  send as many ice cubes as you can to, Burt the Inuit c/o the fourth iceberg to the left of the first igloo the post person comes across&#8230;.  Oooh, here comes the Lithium lady!</p>
<p>Catch ya on the morrow playmates&#8230; BB</p>

					<p>Errrrrrm&#8230;, apparently we&#8217;re a bit short in the ice department?  Well it&#8217;s the first I&#8217;ve heard about!  But the Inuits of Greenland say that they were the first ones to notice the problem.  Burt Inuit, a renowned painter and decorator, was at work one day painting a neighbour&#8217;s igloo, when he noticed that his first coat of paint wouldn&#8217;t dry.  He went back the next day to find that all of the wallpaper he&#8217;d put up had fallen off as well.  Burt is the first casualty of unemployment in that area, which is a bit of a bastard really, as the nearest social security office is 5,433 miles away!</p>
<p>But there is some good news in the offing, the locals can now grow their own vegetables &#8211; whoop-de-fuckin&#8217;-doo!  Mind you the affiliated union of, Polar bears, Seals and things that flap about a lot, are up in paws and flippers over the issue.   Another problem that is a concern for the Inuits nation is the discovery of gold, diamonds and platinum in the area.  They say their land could be overrun by prospectors and they&#8217;re worried that the natural habitat and wildlife will suffer as a consequence.  I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s the least of their worries, you wait until Ronald McDonald and Pizza Hut turns up mate!  Mind you they&#8217;ll have to rejig their menus to accommodate the locals.  &#8220;Blubber and chips for table three Vera, and don&#8217;t forget the Whale sauce luv.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Dear Inuits, have no fear, Bipolar Bill is hear&#8230;  Over the last week I&#8217;ve spent literally seconds devising a, two point, full proof plan for which I want no thanks or remuneration, unless you can rustle up a fridgefreezer large enough to accommodate one small Blue Whale?   My first stratagem is to place a ban on all motor sports that heavily reply on a circular track.  This will reduce the use of fuel being wasted and the amount of carbon emissions too.  Drag racing will then become the number one motor sport, which will be a sight more bloody interesting than seeing a F1 car for just 1.2 seconds shoot past you after you&#8217;ve just spent 60 quid for a ticket at Brands Hatch! </p>
<p>Ploy two, and this is where it really starts get interesting, would be to target all commercial fights and change the way planes fly.  If the trial works that&#8217;s up and running in Jersey as we speak, I hope to roll the scheme out all over the country, and then pass on my findings to the international circuit.  We all know that planes use an immense amount of fuel when taking off, so how can we minimise this waste?  Well I&#8217;ll tell you.  Coasting, or gliding if you will! </p>
<p>We all know if you coast down hill in a car with your foot on clutch you use less petrol, well my plan adopts that idea and applies it to the multitude of planes that fly above us at any given time.  A 100,000 tons they maybe, but even if they run out of &#8216;go-juice&#8217; the buggers will still drift into an airport near you at some point.  A lift will be erected on a runway, a big one, big enough to take a Jumbo jet.  The elevator will raise the plane to a height of about three miles where it can be aimed at it&#8217;s destination.  Then, the platform supporting the plane tips forward and jettisons the flying beast into the wild blue yonder.  This radical piece of engineering will reduce the use of fuel, and the carbon footprint in one fell swoop.  No, no, don&#8217;t thank me, I&#8217;m just here to help.   </p>
<p>You know the worrying part about all of this is, MY DISORDER IS IN REMISSION!!!</p>
