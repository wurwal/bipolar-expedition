				<div class="entry">
					<p> </p>
<p>My problem was how to launch my projectile without throwing it, because I felt that would have been far too easy.  I went through various combinations, finalising them down to three choices.  I could have tried to spit the coin from where I sat.  Then I thought how messy and inaccurate this might be. </p>
<p>My second plan was to flick the penny off the back of my hand.  After some careful deliberation I realised that this idea would be less accurate than my first ploy.  The third option to my mind had the best chance of a successful strike rate.  In front of me at the bar was a large ashtray with a hollow interior. </p>
<p>I placed the copper coin into it and pushed it around with my forefinger and thumb.  It glided from side to side quite freely, offering little resistance against the enamel surface.  The angle of the hollow was roughly 35 degrees from the centre of the ashtray up to the outer rim.  I had a missile, a launch pad and now the use of elevation. </p>
<p>What I was still searching for was a means of propulsion.  This whim of probability was turning into a full-scale experiment.  I wrestled with the physics of what would seem too trivial for anybody else to be bothered with.</p>
<p>I over-lapped my forearms and placed them on the bar.  Resting my chin on the back of my left hand, I pondered on how I would complete this, to me at least, important test.  At this point the ashtray was right under my nose.  As I exhaled I heard the coin wobble against the shiny surface. </p>
<p>I blew out of my mouth; to my surprise I made the penny rattle from one side of the launch pad to the other.  The problem now was with the coin laying flat I didn’t have much of a surface area to blow against.  I seemed to solve one problem, only to be faced with another.</p>
<p>As a true Gemini I get bored easily.  I was beginning to wonder whether using all of this brain power was worth the effort.  For something that was so futile, I had become totally obsessed with finding a solution.  I took a breather from my experiment and wished I hadn’t.  While I was occupied the craving for a cigarette had subsided.  All I could concentrate on now was getting hold of some nicotine. </p>
<p>I scanned the bar like a laser, looking for new, unsuspecting customers.  No such luck, it was just me, the barman, two blokes leaning on the bar and the old man who gave me the roll-up.  Oh, and the little shit with the Benson and Hedges and I wasn’t about to ask him a second time.</p>
<p>I pushed the penny up onto the flat rim of the ashtray, and then knocked it in a few times to pass some idle moments.  I stared at the coin that was now perched over-hanging the hollow of the ashtray.  For know particular reason I blew into the ashtray causing an up-draft.  This in turn knocked my metal missile onto the bar.  I was chuffed to bits, silly sod!  All I had to do now was blow harder, concentrating my breath to a smaller area.</p>
<p>Digressing back to my childhood for a moment, I always liked to know the ‘ins and out’s’ of a ducks arse.  Never happy just playing with a toy, I wanted to find out how it worked, my Dad was the same.  I was given an Etch-a-Sketch on my eleventh birthday, I still have it today.  I did the usual squiggles that everybody did, but I couldn’t draw a perfect circle. </p>
<p>So one afternoon I sat in my bedroom and painstakingly drew lines from one side of the screen to the other.  This process removed all of the graphite from the inside and left the internal workings visible.  You will have to forgive me.  I have now strayed into the areas of probabilities, percentages and an area called, what’s the chance of that happening first time round.  Bear with me; it is relevant to this passage. </p>
<p>I dropped a tailor-made cigarette out of my mouth whilst at work.  I watched as it fell onto the floor and landed on its side.  It then bounced back up in an upright position standing on its filter.  I was amazed at what I had just witnessed.  Come to think of it, I have always liked the thought of long odds.  Mainly because of the possibility that it will come off, it must eventually. </p>
<p>For example, if you spin a coin a given number of times, say 250,000 times, you must be guaranteed an even amount of heads and tails.  But my interest would lie with the probability that at some point the coin would land on its edge.  Back to my glass coconut shy.</p>
<p>I lined my launch pad up with the target area, which was three and a half feet up from the bar and approximately seven feet from where I was sitting.  I leaned over the ashtray and gave one almighty exhalation of breath.  The penny shot high into the air and hit one of the glasses.  It bounced off another, ricocheting off and hit the mirrored surface behind the stack of glasses.  It landed on the shelf with still a few spins left in its momentum before lying down flat. </p>
<p>Blinding, I couldn’t find a fault with my project, except I failed to smash any of the glasses.  Yet again, I had impressed myself, but not the barman.  He heard the end result of my experiment but hadn’t a clue as to what had taken place.  So acting as causally as you can with two wet socks on, I squelched my way back to a seat near the fire, next to a half open window.</p>
<p>The sun had come out and I watched as the traffic ambled by the pub.  A man with tie-back hair and a goatee beard had begun to collect the empties off of the tables.  As he neared my table he asked me if I would mind leaving the pub.  I looked him up and down noticing on his sleeve was a Tai Chi club badge. </p>
<p>I just had a gut feeling that he had probably been doing it longer than me.  I came to the conclusion that I had outstayed my welcome.  Picking up my still sodden moccasins, I beat a slow, calm retreat.  Presumably I went straight home, although my mother seems to think I did wonder off somewhere else.  Usual story I’m afraid, I can’t remember.</p>
<p>I suppose I must have lost two or three hours to my illness, and the side-effects of the medication, during that day.  At five o’clock in the evening Dr Gadhvi had come from Claybury to see how I was.  As I recall he was doing his best to persuade me to return to the hospital.  But I was having none of it. </p>
<p>According to Mum I was so defiant that I ripped up all of my case notes, something I have no recollection of.  My alto ego was obviously taking no shit at this stage of the game.  Dr Gadhvi left saying he would ring at 7.00 p.m. to see if I had changed my mind.  In the meantime a social worker was called as back up, so my Mum wasn’t left stranded.</p>
<p>My next memory of that night was four hours later.  It was dark obviously, and I now had a flat full of people.  Seven o’clock had been and gone and it was now 11pm.  What had happened to the daylight hours, and who was the tall bloke with the leather satchel crammed full of paper-work?</p>
<p> Final part next week&#8230;</p>

					<p> </p>
<p>My calf muscles felt as though I had just got over a bad attack of pins and needles and were slow in response to my brain’s signal to move.  I took a second glance at my feet and noticed I was wearing my moccasin slippers instead of my usual trainers.  “Why did I put these on?”  I exclaimed to an invisible Mr McKenna.  “I told you to put them on,” he gleefully explained.  “Oh smart move,” I replied sarcastically.  “My feet are going to get soaked, it’s started raining.  What the hell is going on and why are you here?  Is this some sort of a test?”</p>
<p>“You could call it that,” he replied calmly, “and you know you’re up against the best don’t you.”  “So this is really happening is it?”  I asked indignantly.  “Very much so,” came the reply.  “Oh, and I forgot to mention, we’re being filmed by Channel 4.”  “So where’s the film crew then?” I asked.  “Invisible, but only to you,” came the retort.</p>
<p>By now I was well past the pissed off stage.  I said to Paul, “I think we had better call a halt to this right now.  I’m not doing anything or going anywhere I don’t want to.  This stops right now.  I feel bad enough about myself on a good day.  I don’t need to be made a fool of in public like this.”</p>
<p>After my speech of disapproval, the now not so smug, Mr McKenna could tell I wasn’t a happy bunny.  I had a double dose of nicotine while I listened to Paul apologise profusely.  Reluctantly, I agreed to carry on with the charade. </p>
<p>“Three…two…one… you’re under,” he said.  “What now,” I asked.  “All you have to do is stop yourself from walking where I take you.”  I felt the weight of his hand on my shoulder and with that, both my legs from the knees downwards turned to lead.  “Still want to go and get your trainers?” Paul inquired.  “Yeah why not.”</p>
<p>It was as if he was turning up the intensity of the hypnosis.  I hated to admit it but I couldn’t move.  The leaden feeling crept up to my waist and was making a B-line for my chest.  “It’s a lot easier if you go with it,” Paul said.   We walked towards the main road and turned left at the traffic lights. </p>
<p>The hill we were about to ascend towards was just under a mile in length, with a gradient of 1 in 3.  The climb was always worth it though.  At the top, stood a sight for sore eyes and a parched throat, the King’s Head.  With the rain still falling from the grey clouds, we began our ascent.  I can vividly recall talking, giggling and swapping jokes with Paul.  By the time we reached the pub, my clothes and footwear were sopping wet.</p>
<p>Once inside the lounge bar, I made myself at home placing my drenched moccasins in front of the open coal fire.  I sunk my left hand deep into my damp pocket, only to find a small amount of fluff and a solitary penny.  “Oh fine.” I muttered under my breath. </p>
<p>Not only was I minus my packet of cigarettes, I didn&#8217;t have any beer vouchers either.  I then remembered the snout I had placed behind my ear.  I reached up to get it.  All that remained of my soggy cigarette was the filter, and a few strands of wet tobacco.  I felt the side of my neck, only to find the rest of my nicotine parcel had left a trail down to the neck of my T-shirt and beyond.  “Oh bollocks,” I mumbled to myself through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>As I sat down at a table near the fire I noticed a young bloke wearing a sharp, dark blue suit.  He was opening a packet of Benson and hedges, “Excuse me,” I said hopefully, “you couldn&#8217;t spare one of those could you?”  The Thatchers’ grandchild looked me up and down and said, “No I can’t.”  Jumped up little shit. I could have slapped him.  I wouldn&#8217;t have asked if I wasn&#8217;t desperate.  Perhaps I didn&#8217;t look desperate enough.</p>
<p>My eternal pub triangle or the reason for being there, what ever that was, now had no sides to it.  No cigarettes and no money equalled no beer.  This stage of the afternoon had just hit the boring zone.  There was no doubt in my mind that I had to re-evaluate my position.  For a start, the wonderful Mr McKenna had buggered off without a trace.  No hint of a kiss my arse, goodbye, nothing.</p>
<p>I couldn’t ask the barman if he could see an invisible film crew, he was giving me funny looks as it was.  Why was I here anyway?  This was beginning to feel like a bad joke at my expense.  I felt a floating sensation wash over me and things didn’t seem so bad.  I walk over to the fruit machine and put my penny in the slot.  Through my eyes at least it looked as though I had won the £20 jackpot.  Beer and cigarettes flashed from my brain&#8217;s memory department like a May Day call.</p>
<p>I pushed the collect button but something was missing.  It was the old familiar sound of clanky bits of loose change hitting the pay out tray.  I looked back up at the screen to see my winnings had vanished.  This was turning out to be, ‘one of those days.’ This is something that still happens to me today but thankfully not so frequently.  I have learnt to cope with the start of feeling high.</p>
<p>I run through a mental checklist:  Have I missed my medication?  Have I eaten?  When did I last have a beer?  When my mouth is working thirty six times faster than my brain, it’s time to sit down and eat something.  Half an hour later my blood’s sugar level has balanced out.  My smoking pattern slows down and my caffeine consumption is drastically reduced.  Then instead of doing seven things at once, I return to the tried and tested method of, one thing at a time.</p>
<p>I retrieved my coin from the reject slot and took a seat next to a bearded man who was parked on a bench seat near the fire.  I asked him if he could spare me some wedge for half a Guinness.  “I can’t do the drink,” he answered, “but your more than welcome to a roll-up.”  “Oh cheers mate; you’re a life-saver.” </p>
<p>By now I was getting that uneasy feeling you get when you know people are starring at you.  So I walked to the end of the bar where there were no customers.  I sat on a bar stool wondering what to do next.  Oddly enough, the thought of going home didn&#8217;t enter my head.</p>
<p>As I looked behind the bar I noticed some long stemmed champagne glasses above the optics.  They had been arranged like a coconut shy but I didn’t have a ball, well not as such.  Although I was on an abnormal high I was still able to judge distance and height.  My grey matter was sifting information, albeit over a trivial task. I was too close to the glass target area to throw my intended missile.  Somehow for, reasons best known to myself, I was intent on making up a challenge.  My prize, a single shot at the glass coconut shy.</p>
<p>I placed my penny on the floor just behind the bar stool.  Then I hooked both of my feet under the foot rail that circled the bar.  Sitting in an upright position, I leant over backwards to see if I could pick up the coin. </p>
<p>It was surprisingly easy, now for the real test of strength; could I pull myself back up?  I felt every muscle in my torso tense up and the blood was pounding around my head.  With my feet still anchored, I raised my body back up to the bar in one slow, meticulous movement.  I have to say I had impressed myself with my abdominal power.  Now it was time to pick up my prize.</p>

				<small>February 11th, 2013 <!-- by Neil --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p> </p>
<p>After Bill and Seron left my buzzed up mood took a dive.  Poor Mum, she had only been there five minutes and already I was asking her to give me some space.  Having the patience of a saint she went to visit and old friend of hers, knowing full well it would give her the opportunity to speak to my GP.  Doctor Gibbon’s advice to my mother was, “Go home Jeanne and give Neil the space he has asked for.” </p>
<p>I did feel embarrassed when Mum told me later what she had said.  That after-noon Mum travelled back to Berkhamsted, saying she would be in touch.  My guardian angel, Bill, had said to Mum he would keep an eye on me, which put her mind at rest.</p>
<p>Later that day Bill popped into see how I was. It’s just as well he did.  I was on a downer and very confused. “Why don’t we go and see your doctor,” he asked.  “Would you come with me?”  “Yeah, no problem.” He replied.  I think because I heard the word doctor, I recall asking him if he could drive as slowly as he could.  I think it was because I was in no rush to go back in the ‘fun palace.’ </p>
<p>Doctor Gibbon had opened the surgery on this Saturday afternoon to see me personally.  Now that’s what I call a National Heath Service.  I was in such a state of confusion, apparently, that when she asked a question I drifted off mentally.  I can vaguely remember mumbling away to myself as I sat cross-legged on the doctor’s couch.</p>
<p>She gave me a large red tablet to take.  This was to stop me getting any higher throughout the rest of the day.  She also gave Bill a second tablet in a brown envelope for me to take at 9.00 p.m. that evening.  Bill said he would make sure I took it.  The whole week-end felt surreal, even more so after taking the medication.  What a result, my doctor’s being open on a Saturday!  I really was a punnet short of a strawberry that day.  Doctor Gibbon asked me if there was anything else I needed or wanted.</p>
<p>I thought for a moment, this being the only question I actually understood, and said, “Well, I could do with, a good, hard, shag.”  In complete control and with only a hint of a smile she replied, “I’m afraid we don’t that on the N.H.S.”  At the time I was totally oblivious as to just how funny that must have sounded.  Months later Bill reminded me of what I had said and we fell about laughing.  It was nice to know that I still had the ability to make people laugh.</p>
<p>I lost the rest of Saturday and the majority of Sunday to the powerful medication I was given.  Bill contacted my Mum to explain what had happened at the surgery.  She was back on my door-step the very next day.  I had completely lost the plot this time.  For reasons best known to me I decided to put some of my tools in the washing machine and turn it on. </p>
<p>Can you imagine the noise!  God knows how long they were in there clanking around before Mum switched it off.  I, of course, was totally oblivious to the row, thanks to the high I was on.  From what I can gather, the best way to describe how I acting was to watch a four year old child at play.</p>
<p>As usual I had lost all concept of time, and was totally reliant on other people.  It’s a wonder I didn&#8217;t start a fire, as I smoke.  I guess I had a taste of what some people would like to experience again, a second child-hood.  It’s a shame I can’t remember more of those seventy-two hours, perhaps its better I can’t.  I sometimes wish, when I hit a low spot, the whole twelve years of my illness had been like that lost weekend.  As it is, I will remain mentally scared for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>I awoke with a start early on Monday morning after having a nightmare.  I had dreamt that I saw my Mum was dying.  She looked surprised to see me presenting her with a cup of tea but I wasn&#8217;t to know it was half-past-five in the morning.  I gave a sigh of relief to see my little Mum was still breathing.  The next twelve hours were hectic to say the least. </p>
<p>Prior to Mums’ arrival I had become obsessed with colour co-ordinating my clothes, all of which I separated to those of the armed forces, from khaki through to navy blue.  I put the trousers on hangers followed by the shirts and then their jackets.  Any other tops or T-shirts that were left over I rolled up as you would a flag and placed them on a work-top next to the kitchen sink.  At this point everything had to be spotlessly clean and tidy; I also polished all of my shoes and boots, putting clean socks in each pair.</p>
<p>I had stumbled into another fantasy, now believing that whatever colour top I had on in the morning was the service I had secretly been drafted into.  If I saw someone in the street with a similar colour scheme as mine they were also in the same force.  Because this would have been a hush-hush operation, I was left to guess as to what rank the other people held. </p>
<p>On this one particular day I had put on a white T- shirt and a pair of navy blue jogging bottoms. I was convinced I was a Naval rating who had been granted shore leave.  So where would I go with my imaginary forty-eight hour pass?  That’s right, the nearest grog shop. </p>
<p>Days earlier I had finger-knitted a wrist-band made from white string.  This was something my dad had taught me to do as a boy.  Basically, it was a means of shortening a length of rope. I just adapted it for my own purposes.  I tore off a segment from a matchbox and wrapped it around a solitary match.  Then I poked it through the plaited twine. </p>
<p>As I pulled the wrist-band back into shape the string gripped my make-shift source of ignition.  With this in place I turned the band around so the match and its wrapping faced my wrist and just touched the palm of my hand.</p>
<p>My reason for this elaborate process was obvious, but of course only to me.  Although I was on shore-leave it occurred to me that I may be called upon to do a four-hour watch, well you would wouldn’t you?  Christ knows where of course, the nearest ship was bloody miles away.  Still you never know somebody might have gone down with scurvy on HMS Belfast! </p>
<p>Anyway I wasn’t going out without a fag on me, so I tucked one behind my ear. I was in a world of my own, where it seemed my subconscious had overridden my conscious mind.  I can’t even remember where my Mum was before I went walk-about.  I do however recall my personality changing from a serious mood to a jovial one and back again, as if someone had flicked a light-switch on.</p>
<p>At this juncture my imaginary furlough began to merge with a new fantasy.  In my head, clear as a bell, I heard the voice of Paul McKenna the hypnotist.  I was now under his control, something that was to occur again.  Not only could I hear him, I could even feel the weight of his arm through mine as he led me into the car park of the flats where I lived. </p>
<p>“Hold up,” I said, “where are we going?”  “Oh, just a little stroll,” he replied smugly.  “But I don’t want to go for a walk thanks.” I said in disbelief. “Well just try and stop yourself then,” he answered with a chortle.</p>
<p>So I tried to turn round, my upper body moved but my feet were firmly stuck to the pavement.  The fantasy hypnosis was incredibly powerful.  Try as I might I couldn&#8217;t break free from its grip.  I heard Paul say, “Okay, okay, I’ll give you a sporting chance.  After the count of three I’ll release your feet, ready, one… two… three…”</p>

				<small>February 3rd, 2013 <!-- by Neil --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p> </p>
<p>I returned to my doctors and asked for my medication to be changed, as I felt too high most of the time.  But I think it was too late by then, the Prozac and drink had done its damage.  So it was back to a standard anti-depressant and its side-effects.  This was fine for a while, until I woke up one morning with the old familiar black cloud hanging over me again. </p>
<p>As you’re probably aware there seems to be a vast difference in side-effects depending on which drugs you are prescribed.  If you are not happy with the drugs you are taking, go back to your doctor and ask for them to be changed.  Don’t stay on something if it’s making you feel odd. (This is the only way I can describe the ‘vague feeling of being unwell,’ printed on the paperwork in most anti-depressant packets.)  This can just as easily fuck up your life in the same way that a nervous breakdown does.</p>
<p>I was showing signs of cracking under pressure at work.  I was losing the ability to concentrate and I felt tired all of the time.  My confidence was fast diminishing also.  The timing couldn&#8217;t have been worse for me.  Five months into the job I was asked if I would go on a shift rota.  I was in a tenuous position financially and felt obliged to agree to my line manager’s demands.  I was still biting the bullet regarding spilling the beans about my first nervous break-down.</p>
<p>The shift required was a week of lates and a week of early’s.  Things were okay to begin with, but after a few months I found it harder and harder to cope.  Until one night I sat in front of a job, when everybody had gone home, for three hours not knowing where to start.  My work chum wasn’t best pleased the next day.</p>
<p>He wasn’t just angry, he was seething. I tried frantically to explain, but he had an answer for everything and I didn’t.  I’m sure you can imagine the atmosphere in the minuscule room.  I could feel waves of hate washing over me for most of the morning.  After that one incident I was scared stiff of making any other mistakes.  My work partner seemed fine as long as everything went his way.  I suppose there is something to be said for nepotism.  All the same I had never encountered such hostility over a poxy four colour job before.</p>
<p>It hadn’t occurred to me that a different shift would affect my mental state.  I had worked on day shifts for over seventeen years up until that point.  But the change in working nights affected my sleep pattern from week to week, which in turn affected my eating cycle.  Consequently I drifted into a series of high and low episodes.  Eventually after being a pain in the arse for months, I came down to earth with an almighty bang.</p>
<p>My boss gave me a month off to sort myself out, but I was too far gone by then.  In the end I asked to be made redundant.  The highs only got higher after that; I called this period, the ‘walking on water’ stage.  At some point during my well months, I stupidly reduced my medication, over a three-month period, without my doctors’ knowledge.  Don’t even contemplate trying this. </p>
<p>Prior to all of my stays in hospital there was always an abundance of incidences leading up to admission.  This was largely due to the Mental Health Act of 1983, which roughly states, that unless a person is a danger to themselves or others, they can’t be picked up by the old bill and carted off to the nearest fun factory.  On this spree of events Mum, Bill and Seron helped to fill in the blank spaces of my second admission into Claybury Hospital.</p>
<p>Mum was coming over to see me knowing I wasn’t quite the whole nine yards again.  My sleep pattern was all over the shop, and I had stopped eating.  On this particular Saturday morning, I had phoned Bill begging him and his wife, Seron to come down to my flat.</p>
<p>The night before, I had painstakingly re-assembled my drum kit in my front room.  For some reason I had decided to do this in the pitch dark at about 3.00 a.m., don’t ask why, I haven’t a clue.  I was doing everything in slow motion at that point; I believed my patience was being tested in some way.</p>
<p>Normally it would take me forty minutes or so to put my kit together, but on this occasion the conditions were far from normal.  I had it in my head that my flat was bugged.  To add to my dilemma, I had to take each piece of equipment from a back bedroom, up the creaking hallway and into the front-room. </p>
<p>Rhyme, reason and time-scale had abandoned me yet again, save the odd glance at the clock.  It took me over two and a half hours to put up my drum kit, which I managed to do in near silence.  Bill and Seron arrived about mid-day.  They were visibly taken aback by the sight that had met their eyes.  They were equally surprised to see that I had taken the mattresses off the bunk beds and was now using them as sound-proofing.</p>
<p>Bill and I had played together in a band for a number of years.  He was the guitarist.  One of our high-points was a Radio 1 session on the Janice Long show.  The creative buzz that I had all those years ago had returned and, three months prior to this, I had blown the dust off my sticks and begun to practise again.  Of all the music I listened to, one song held my attention, ‘Seven Days’, by Sting.  It’s a peach of a track in 7/8 time, and after weeks of warming up to 4/4 music it became the only song I would play.</p>
<p>Initially I sat for hours listening to the track as a whole, and then gradually broke the drum-patterns down into sections.  Once I had the bass and snare firmly fixed in my mind, I concentrated on the cymbal pushes and finally I worked on all of the drum-fills.  The only part I couldn’t perfect was a short section just before the song fades out; the drummer does too many fills for my little head to remember.  Now all I wanted to do was play it at the proper volume and see if I could still hack it as a drummer.</p>
<p>Bill and Seron sat and listened dutifully as I cranked up the stereo and put the tape on.  I played the song once, and once only, using my speakers as a make-shift fold back system.  One to the left of me standing on a stool and the other, to my right, angled up at forty-five degrees at the base of my Hi- hat stand.  When the track finished I said out loud, “Still got it.”  That single performance was all the gratification I needed or expected.  The next couple of hours were spent rifling through my record and tape collection reminiscing.</p>
<p>At 2.00 p.m. Mum arrived to find Bill, Seron and myself knee-deep in vinyl, cassettes and album covers.  “What’s all this then?”  She asked.  Seron assured her that there had only been one floor-show that afternoon. </p>
<p>“Just as well really,” she replied starring at me in disbelief.  “What must have the neighbours thought?”  “Sod the neighbours,” I said.  Unfortunately my words opened up Mum’s entire book of stock phrases, volume one.  Starting with, “Well that’s all right for you to say,” and ending with, “And another thing, did you think about that?” </p>
<p>By the time she had gone through her entire repertoire, I had made a sandwich, eaten it and poured her out a cup of coffee.  This was the only way to stop her drifting into her second volume of nagging for the Home Counties North, advanced level.</p>
