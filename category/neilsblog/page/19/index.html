				<h2><a href="../../../../memo-suicide-bombers-union-and-affiliated-members/index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Memo: Suicide Bomber&#8217;s Union and Affiliated Members">Memo: Suicide Bomber&#8217;s Union and Affiliated Members</a></h2>
				<small>January 10th, 2010 <!-- by Neil --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Suicide bombers in Britain are set to begin a three-day strike on Monday in a dispute over the number of virgins they are entitled to in the afterlife.  In other parts of the world a &#8216;go slow&#8217; is already in operation.  Emergency talks with Al Qaeda have so far failed to produce an agreement. </p>
<p>Problems began on MichaelmasThursday, when Al Qaeda announced that the number of virgins a bomber would receive after his death will be cut by 25% in February 2010, from 72 to only 60.5  The rationale for the cut was the increase in recent years of the amount of suicide bombings, and a subsequent shortage of virgins in the afterlife.  Union members are said to be up in arms and down in legs, and a spokesperson from Y FRONTS R US said they have noticed a fall in sales already, they are worried  that the bottom will drop out of the market.    A market research Analyst said, &#8220;The figures have been blown up out of all proportion.&#8221;  </p>
<p>The suicide bombers&#8217; union, the British Organisation of Occupational Martyrs (or B.O.O.M.) responded with a statement that this was unacceptable to its members and immediately balloted for strike action.  General secretary Abdullah Amir told the press, &#8220;Our members are literally working themselves to death in the cause of jihad.  We don&#8217;t ask much in return but to be treated like this by the management is the last straw, and if they try to take our tea breaks away there will be trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Amir accepted the limited availability of virgins, but pointed out that cutbacks were expected to be borne entirely by the workforce and not by the management.  &#8220;Last Christmas Abu Hamza alone was allocated an annual bonus of 24,000 virgins,&#8221; complains Amir.  &#8220;And let&#8217;s face it, all of the pretty ones go to the guys at the top of the pyramid.  How can Al Qaeda afford that for members of management but not for the 72 people who do the real work?&#8221; </p>
<p>Speaking from a kipper splitting factory in Bognor, Al Qaeda CEO Osama bin-Laden explained, &#8220;We sympathise with our workers, however, Al Qaeda is simply not in a position to meet their demands.  They are simply not accepting the realities of a modern-day jihad, in a competitive marketplace.  Thanks to western depravity, there is now a chronic shortage of virgins in the afterlife, and Haringey.  It&#8217;s a straight choice between reducing expenditure and laying people off.  I don&#8217;t like cutting wages, but I&#8217;d hate to have to inform 3,489 of my staff  that they won&#8217;t be able to blow themselves up, they would go to pieces.  He defended management bonuses by claiming these were necessary to attract good fanatical clerics.  &#8220;How am I supposed to attract the best people if I can&#8217;t compete with the private sector.&#8221;  Asked Mr Bin-Laden.</p>
<p>Talks broke down today after management&#8217;s last-ditch proposal of a virgin-sharing scheme was rejected outright after a failure to agree on orifice allocation quotas.  One virgin, who didn&#8217;t want to be named said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be buggered if I&#8217;m agreeing to anything like that, it&#8217;s to much to swallow, and besides, what would the neighbours think?&#8221;  </p>
<p>Unless some sort of agreement is reached over the weekend, suicide bombers will put down their explosives at midday on Monday.  Most branches are supporting the strike.  Only the north London branch, which has a different union, is likely to continue working.  However, some members of that branch will only be using half-strength explosives, in order to express solidarity with their striking brethren&#8230; Further talks will be held next week.</p>

<p>Apologies for missing last weeks blog, I couldn&#8217;t get into the system.  Well, it&#8217;s come to the point in the year where I have to bugger off for a bit and hibernate.  The minute the clocks go back my mood take a nose-dive.  I don&#8217;t get depressed, I just feel a bit flat.  It&#8217;s a cycle that started about 10 years ago so I know what to expect, but the important thing is the feeling always passes, so I&#8217;ll have sit tight and wait.   Before I slope off, I leave you with a few quotes, and a poem and wish you all a Merry Happy Jingle Balls, and I&#8217;ll catch up with you in the New Year&#8230;</p>

					<p>The Iraq inquiry.  Well, the plebs on the street, that&#8217;s you andme, will never get the real answers to that.  There&#8217;s a bloody great new boat that swanning a round the Med at the moment that can carry 9,000 passengers.  Let&#8217;s hope they&#8217;ve got enough lifeboats!  Oh, and there was a  few drops of rain over Cumbria last week, which pretty much flooded most of Cockermouth, but nothing that really took my fancy.  So this week I&#8217;ll add another part of my next book.</p>
<p>This story comes from one of the happiest periods of my life, back in the days when I worked in the lithographic trade. To this day I don&#8217;t know how we used to get any work done, as we seemed to spend most of the time annoying the tea lady&#8217;s, laughing, and winding up the boys in the firm.   The place was known as &#8216;The Mad House&#8217; by anyone who worked there, and it was the scene of many a silly situation.  This particular episode  concerns one of lads in the office.  He came a cropper when he walked into the plate making department one day, at a time when the work had dropped off, and the plate makers were bored&#8230; </p>
<p>The apprentices were our main targets for japes and entertainment when the work dropped off, but the boys in the office weren&#8217;t immune from the windups, ritual verbal abuse and the odd light beating.  Some were afraid to walk through the proofing department, and one kid left the day after joining the firm as I believe the first words he heard from one of the proofers was, &#8220;I&#8217;ve shagged yer mum, and yer dad,&#8221; and he followed it up with, &#8220;You haven&#8217;t got a sister &#8216;ave you?&#8221;  Another boy filled his shoes a week later, and the proofers jumped on him, posing a mock query on a job spec.  A client wanted a bunch of special colours to wrap around his biscuit tin, so they asked the fresh lamb to pop along to see our ever jovial store man, to see if the tartan ink had been delivered!  He arrived, job bag in hand, only to be to, &#8220;Fuck off, and stop asking stupid bloody questions.&#8221; </p>
<p>The next day he was walking through my department, when a workmate noticed his brightly coloured tie.  He engaged him in a futile conversation and then said to me, &#8220;&#8216;ere Neil, look at that tie, I bet you wouldn&#8217;t cut in half.&#8221;  I said, &#8220;How much?&#8221;  &#8220;Thruppence,&#8221; came the reply.  &#8220;Done,&#8221; I said, and with that I snipped it in two with my scissors.  Witnessing that clothing wasn&#8217;t a barrier to us, the office boyss came up with a new survival technique to get them through the day.  A few would exit the firm and re-enter at another point, just to bypass the proofers and plate makers.  Others would feign leg injures or death to drop someone else in it, rather than face the walk of certain ridicule themselves. </p>
<p>Come the morning of &#8216;The Great Soaking&#8217; the plate makers were in fine fettle.  The work had eased off, and it was playtime, where quite honestly anything could happen.  Our Irish tea lady copped the first wave of inane banter, and she was now in charge of going out for our mid-morning grub.  This was the woman that came into the firm one day complaining that her feet hurt; when we looked down we saw that she had her boots on the wrong feet!  As usual, she already had a certain amount of dubious request on her list.  Item one was a whelk yogurt, and from the bakers she was asked if she could get a fresh pie, a bun cup and two pregnant tarts!  Anyway, as she was doing the rounds in our department one of the office boys drifted in, and as he was walking past one of our sinks, our foreman, Mick asked if he would fill it up.  He put the plug in, turned on the tap, and began searching through our job rack looking for a bag of films. </p>
<p>At this point I should explain that our sinks were a tad larger then your average household fitting, quite a lot larger actually.  A six foot man would&#8217;ve had no trouble in lying flat out in one, with his arms and legs spread open.  He could also have had a bath if he wanted too, as they were roughly two feet deep.  Well, our victim had been rifling through the job rack for 15 minutes or more, and he eventually found what he was looking for, and he was just about to return to the office when Mick asked him to turn the tap off for him.  Then he made a fatal mistake.  He asked our foreman if there was anything else he wanted him to do before he disappeared.  &#8220;Well, get in of course,&#8221; Mick replied.  There was a sort of stunned silence, followed by a look of impending doom about his face when he realised what department he was in.  Then, in a fit of peak, he made a break for the door, the door that somebody had locked quite recently! </p>
<p>He put up a hell of a struggle for someone of his slight stature and weight, but overall he was only ever going one place before making his way back to the safety of the office.  Splash he went; soaked from head to foot, an excellent way to start the day off.  He gave up in the end of course, and ended up laughing his face off, we grabbed him some overalls, and a coat from the stores, and someone lent him a pair of trainers.  He dried himself off, and eventually made it back to the office in his new attire.  Just over an hour later he returned with a jubilant smile of acceptance on his face, and he&#8217;d come back to check on his clothes, which were drying off in the boiler room.  His shirt, boxers and socks were nearly wearable, but his jeans and shoes were still way off being dry.  He still had a good few hours to go before clocking off, but he was concerned about his shoes, so one of our apprentices said he&#8217;d spend some time blowing warm air into them using one of our plate driers, which was just like a big hair drier.  He seemed happy with that and went on his way.</p>
<p>An hour before knocking off, Martin returned to see if his strides were ready to wear, but they weren&#8217;t.  The legs were almost dry, but the waist band, the pockets and parts of the seat of his jeans were still damp.  As he was beginning to look despondent, and I didn&#8217;t want to see him upset further, I said he might as well put them in out plate oven to speed up the process.  What I didn&#8217;t know, because I&#8217;d been working in another part of the firm for most of the afternoon, was that the oven had been on for most of the day. </p>
<p>We used to bake some of our plates as it gave the images on them a longer life when they were used for long print runs for jobs like Dulux paint tins.  I felt the side of the oven and, although it was still hot, it was starting to cool down, so I hooked his jeans onto one of the oven racks, slide it in and closed the door.  I told Martin to come back in 15 minutes, so he wondered off, and I picked up another job from the rack.  Another key factor that I wasn&#8217;t aware of was that the oven, which was electric, had only just been turned off.  Worse still it was cooling down from a temperature of 700 degrees &#8211; whoops!</p>
<p>The time slipped by, as it does when you&#8217;ve got your head buried in your work, and I&#8217;d completely forgotten about what was simmering in the oven.  Suddenly, a frantic office boy burst back into my department, with a worried look on his face, as he knew he was five minutes later than he should have been.  Now having the attention of the whole plate making staff, I un-clipped the oven door and pulled out the rack with a pair of heavy-duty heat resistant gloves.  At first glance you couldn&#8217;t help but notice that something wasn&#8217;t quite as it should have been.  My co-workers reinforced this observation by collapsing, one by one, over their workbenches.  The jeans entered the oven with the dark blue colour usually associated with this apparel.  However, on their exit from Satan&#8217;s sandwich maker they were now an unhealthy shade of brown.  &#8220;Well,&#8221; I said with straight face, &#8220;at least they seem to be dry now.&#8221;  The whole floor burst out laughing.  Martin looked at me, and then at his well cooked jeans in total disbelief.  Gingerly he touched one of the legs with the tip of a solitary forefinger, and then watched as they disintegrated into dust on the floor before him.  It was just like watching a clip form a Tommy and Jerry cartoon&#8230;</p>
<p>No apprentices were harmed in the production of this episode.  </p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know about you but, aren&#8217;t you just a tad bored with what Ms Price aka Jordan is up too next?   The spin-offs from her soppy life-style have got beyond a joke, especially when you consider there are more interesting subjects to worry about.  And who gives a shit about what Peter Andre is doing next week?  There&#8217;s two programmes right there where the airtime could have been better filled.  I mean, there are actually people on the planet who haven&#8217;t got enough water to drink.  Hasn&#8217;t anyone realised that she pays someone to come up with next ridiculous story in her so-called life?  She is a cute business person, there&#8217;s no doubt about that, but her morals suck.   </p>
<p>It&#8217;s got false fun-bags, a reconstructed face and bright white teeth, it&#8217;s just a shame that she didn&#8217;t spend any money on her brain.   &#8220;Mummy, what did you do for a living when we were growing up?&#8221;  &#8220;Well, I used to get my tits out on a regular basis, I made a home porn film, which mysteriously got leaked to the press, and married an idiot and got paid to make it all into a TV programme.  &#8220;Will we get ridiculed at school because of your past mummy?&#8221;  &#8220;Ooh no, well not much anyway!&#8221; </p>
<p>We&#8217;ve gone from, What Katie did next, then the farce that was &#8216;The Wedding&#8217; and the spin-off from that was, What Peter did next, after the split.  Who&#8217;s funding this shit?  The gossip mags, and the twats that buy them because they haven&#8217;t got a life of their own I feel.   And now her mum and brother have got in on the act when they appeared on the day time television show, This Morning.  I only hope that those two don&#8217;t get a show each, but I reckon it&#8217;s on the cards  And let&#8217;s not forget Katie&#8217;s cleaner and all of her relatives and friends too. </p>
<p>The This Morning slot was one of the most inane pieces of television I have ever seen.  &#8220;Katie has gone to the jungle to acquireclosure,&#8221; apparently &#8211; awww bless.  And there was me thinking it was for the alleged £500,000 pay cheque.   &#8220;She wanted a space were she could be alone.&#8221;   Well, I can&#8217;t think of a better place to go than a jungle set with 12 other people she&#8217;s never met, oh, and let&#8217;s not forget the 20 hidden cameras.   Have you ever heard such a load of old bollocks!   Of course, we might all be in for a shock when Katie Jordan Price (it&#8217;s the same person, unless she has a personality disorder) hands over ALL of the wonga she acquired for her return to the jungle, to Water Aid.  Could happen, but don&#8217;t hold your breath!</p>
<p>BB has got to go now as I start a new college course, next week.  Yes, I going to be&#8230; a seahorse whisperer&#8230;</p>
<p>Name check:  Billy Twevletrees.  (cricketer)  Where do you pick up a last name like that?</p>

<p>What did Katie Price and Peter Andre do next &#8211; WHO GIVES A SHIT!?</p>
<p>Have you ever seen a parking meter being emptied?</p>
<p>Would the Psoriasis Society ever consider promoting a scratch card?</p>
<p>If trees were interested in mathematics, would they have square roots?</p>
<p>How much would the sea level drop, if you removed all of the marine craft in the world?</p>
<p>If I had a hole in my mattress, would I lose sleep?</p>
<p>What do vegetarians do if they contract Chickenpox?</p>
<p>Have you ever heard a cat fart?</p>
<p>Does your cat walks past the toilet when you&#8217;re flushing it and think, &#8220;I wish mine did that?&#8221;</p>
<p>If a person left an inordinate amount of spaces between each sentence they spoke, and then they passed away, would they have died of natural pauses? </p>
<p>If a sloth was suffering from depression, how would you know?</p>
<p>Well I&#8217;m glad I got that of my chest&#8230;</p>

					<p>Well it seems as though the news is much the same as last week, a bit of death, and the economy is still shite, despite what the government figures say, so here&#8217;s a piece from my next book.  Again, it&#8217;s a true story, so I hope it causes a few grins.  Of course it may put you off chocolate Brazil nuts for life!  </p>
<p>Now this particular story isn&#8217;t a totally unique one.  I&#8217;ve heard it before, but as it&#8217;s a true story, and not just an urban myth I think it&#8217;s worth an airing, especially as it was an account that was witnessed, first hand, by a friend&#8217;s mother who used to work in the social services sector.</p>
<p>It was her first week at her health unit for the elderly, and Mrs Lim was fresh out of college.  She was given a few days to get the run of the place, and went out on calls with the resident nurses to meet the people on, what would become, her patch.  She fitted in well, and was a hit with all of her new patients, and one of her regulars was a pensioner called, Margret.  Eighty-four she might have been, but she still had most of her faculties, she was fit for her age, and she had a healthy appetite too.</p>
<p>At the end of Mrs Lim&#8217;s first month Margret decided she wanted to give her a small present, just as a thank you for the help she&#8217;d given her.  However, Margret would have a fight on her hands, as the nursing weren&#8217;t supposed to accept gifts from their patients.  After much badgering she persuaded Mrs Lim to take a bag of Brazil nuts, and asked her to share them out with her friends at the unit, which she did.  A month went by and Margret presented Mrs Lim with another bag of Brazils, but Mrs Lim had to put her foot down this time, and went on to explain that it wasn&#8217;t just the fact that the staff weren&#8217;t allowed to accept gifts, there was also the mater of the cost to take into consideration.</p>
<p>Margret had an answer to everything and said, &#8220;Oh I don&#8217;t buy them, my daughter gets them for me when she goes to the supermarket, I&#8217;ve got lots of them.&#8221;  Mrs Lim then pondered on the thought that they must be difficult to eat, even with a set of false teeth, and mentioned this point to Margret before returning to the clinic.  A chipper Margret replied, &#8220;Oooh no, I threw my teeth away 40 years ago, no when I get them they&#8217;re covered in chocolate, so I just suck it all off and keep the nuts in a bag, and then give them to my friends.&#8221;  Ewwwwwwwwwww!  Happy Christmas&#8230;        </p>
<p>Oooh, don&#8217;t forget, next week is &#8216;sandblast a leper&#8217; in The Sun, week!</p>

					<p>Well, well, well.  How long have we been in a financial slump?  About a year?  And in all that time we haven&#8217;t heard a thing from the credit card companies, until now.  Yes, it&#8217;s only taken a ball-park figure of a trillion pounds worth of debt, on plastic, for someone to say, &#8220;Wait a minute, I think we should try and get some of that back, it looks like it&#8217;s getting a bit sticky out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thatcher &#8216;the milk snatcher&#8217; started a depression back in the early 80&#8217;s, and I, and many others suffered thanks to her, and I detest her with a passion.  The Tories were against a closed shop and the unions, so she and a few friends of hers came up with a whizzo plan, changed the laws, and reduced the unions power to a minimum.  However, the closed shop that still remains today, and does have a licence to print money, is the banking fraternity, and it&#8217;s only a select few who actually know how it works.  So in effect a Tory closed shop is fine, but a naughty working class closed shop isn&#8217;t!  And in real terms the caring sharing Tory-lead banking system is being kept afloat by, wait for it, wait for it&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; the very people who aren&#8217;t privy to ways of the financial world, but cough up the most.</p>
<p>Let me simplify a basic figure for you.  There&#8217;s a little gang of people, 0.001 percent, to be precise, and they&#8217;re in charge of a game and are the only ones who know the rules.   In the middle of that is you and me, and they&#8217;ve been fleecing us for years.  What they do is sit in a room and come up with schemes to separate you from your earnings. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one for you, a hedge fund.  What the hell&#8217;s that all about?  And their best wheeze yet, the credit card.  The funny thing is, although you see the word &#8216;credit&#8217; you&#8217;re always in debit from the moment you signed the forms and posted them off.  Capital One sent a letter to one of their customers informing him that his interest rate had been raised, to the bargain basement figure of 39%.   HAPPY CHRISTMAS!   How about they change the name of the card?  Let&#8217;s not call it a CREDIT card because it&#8217;s misleading, lets call it a, SKINT card or a CAN&#8221;T REALLY AFFORD IT card, and see how many new customers sign up. </p>
<p>Ooh, one last thing.  A wealthy person can run up a debt of a million.  Do they have to pay it back?  Naaaaa, can&#8217;t have people like that worrying over fiddling small change, and the bank will right it off.  But, bloody but then, if a 9-5 work-pleb in a crap job defaults on his card by say, £700 they&#8217;re taken to court.   Maybe, just maybe, the banks should take a look at their Duty of Care policy and see if they can come up with a fair system, just a thought&#8230;</p>
<p>Right, I&#8217;m off to Millets to buy some exploding trousers  BB</p>

					<p>Oh dear, oh dear, I do believe that Mr Nick Griffin got a taste of what it&#8217;s like to be detested on the BBC&#8221;s programme,  Question Time, last night.  Hopefully this will be a life lesson for him.  He was, without doubt, out numbered, and I have to say I enjoyed watching him squirm because deep down I think he knows he&#8217;s in the wrong, but couldn&#8217;t face the embarrassment of admitting it.    To get the real low-down on him you&#8217;d have to ask his wife, or better still, his mum, now that would make a great programme wouldn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>So what did we make of Nick&#8217;s performance?  Well, I saw sweating, shaking, inane smiling to cover his informational errors, and a profusion of nervous grinning.  What was fact, he denied.  Which were the lies?  Asked Dimbleby.  &#8220;Far to many to go into.&#8221;  Had he denied the Holocaust?  With a little smile he replied, &#8220;I do not have a conviction for Holocaust denial.&#8221;  &#8220;I am not a Nazi and never have been.&#8221;  Yet Griffin was convicted in 1998 of <em>inciting racial hatred </em>for articles that denied the Holocaust and praised the Waffen-SS.   I&#8217;m sure the ratings went through the roof at the BBC, but really Griffin only succeeded in making a prat of himself.   Educated he may be, but I believe he&#8217;s forgotten one basic element of the British people, and that&#8217;s our use of applying common sense.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a Nazi, my father was in the RAF during the second world war.&#8221;  What the fuck is that supposed to mean? </p>
<p>Then we got into a bit of a muddle I think.  One black member of the audience said, &#8220;I was born in England, educated in England, I love my country, where do you want me to go?&#8221;   Mr Griffin replied, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to leave.&#8221;  Oh I see, it&#8217;s just some black or ethnic minorities that he wants out!  That&#8217;s much clearer.  So a child born in this country can stay, but the parents will be shipped out!  I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s thought his party&#8217;s policies through, perhaps they change on a weekly basis.  If that&#8217;s the case, how the hell will his voters know what&#8217;s going on?  Aaah, now that my friends is where the controlling factor comes in.   Say one thing, do another &#8211; brilliant.  That&#8217;s very close the &#8216;Mushroom effect&#8217; you know.  Keep &#8217;em in the dark, and crap on them twice a day.</p>
<p>Well it seems as though Nick-baby has sorted out immigration.  How could you title it without wanting to get it splashed all over the papers?  Ummm, ooh I know, lets call it, &#8220;a sort of bloodless genocide.&#8221;  The only way I&#8217;m going lose my English identity is when I&#8217;m pushing up the daisy!   Oh there&#8217;s so much more I could write about, his American &#8216;friends&#8217; for example, and people who &#8216;bat for the other side,&#8217; but I&#8217;ve got better things to do quite frankly.  And when all said and done, I can&#8217;t help but feel as though someone else has tried this in another country, and he stole his logo from someone else&#8230;   So on that basic level, you teach your kids to steal and see how they turn out&#8230;</p>
<p>Right, I&#8217;m off to knit my lunch, BB</p>
