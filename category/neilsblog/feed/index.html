					<description><![CDATA[My thoughts have been confimed, I can make people laugh just by writting the stories down.  Please see the Amazon reviews below&#8230; Now, whether it&#8217;s becuase I have a bipolar disorder or not I&#8217;m unsure but, I&#8217;ve never been comfortable with accepting compliments as it feels as if I have something to boast about and [&#8230;]]]></description>

Now, there is a gap here.  Well actually it’s more of a chasm.  This would be your worst nightmare captured on celluloid.  My last memories of that night were of an awful black, dreamlike sensation.  More tablets or an injection I suspect.  The floors and walls seemed to be made [&#8230;]]]></description>
