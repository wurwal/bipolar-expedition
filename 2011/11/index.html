<p>He’s got a face you could quite happily slap with a box jellyfish and somehow, from a rock pool in Barking, he’s crawled his way out and is now a member of the European Parliament.  Nick ‘Would you let me kiss your baby’ Griffin made a complete arse of himself recently on Question Time and now the BNP have been investigated by the Panorama team in a programme aired the BBC called, The Fraud Exposed.  The words ‘smoke’ and ‘fire’ come to mind…</p>
<p>Now we all know political parties have their secret funders, and you can’t help but wonder why you would want to remain anonymous?  Some might say it’s because of their integrity and others may say it’s purely down to personal choice, but I’m not sure this is the case when you pledged your allegiance to the British Nasty Party. </p>
<p>If I didn&#8217;t know better I’d say they were spineless coward’s ladies and gentlemen, cowards with something to hide.  Although   from the outside looking in, it seems as if these private funders are embarrassed to be openly associated with this party because of their views on the far right and want to protect their careers.    </p>
<p>I mean, just at a basic level, would you vote for a person who surrounds himself with ‘knuckle grazers’ who only learned to walk upright that week.  Have you seen them?  They all look as if they should be working on the door at an east end night club!  Call me Mr Picky, but wouldn&#8217;t it give off a better air if heir Griffin used professional security guards! </p>
<p>Over the years its clarity and access to information that makes a party popular , that’s why most political parties have a registered HQ which is accessible to the public, and its run by a thoroughly nice chap or ‘chapess’ and an administrator.  Why, there would even be a sign on the outside of the building that would welcome you in for a chat.  Not so for the, so called, British Neurosis Party       </p>
<p>Imagine the meeting somewhere in Barking, east London.  “Where can we set up our HQ so all of our members can drop by and tarry awhile over our policies?  Ooh, I know, how about a low industrial estate in east Belfast!  And who should we approach to set up this base of warm accessibility?  How about that friendly former Ulster Loyalist and fund raiser Jim Dowson?  Perfect!” </p>
<p>The BNP were resident at this unit for two and a half years, there were CCTV cameras everywhere, but what they didn’t have was a sign outside stating who they were.  Very odd don’t you think?  Surely, if they were that popular they would advertise their party and proclaim their open door policy to their proud members one and all?  Conning the thick and the easily led if you ask me!</p>
<p>As the big bucks began rolling in Mr Griffin had elevated his status to an MEP.  Now would be the perfect time to acquire a decent residence for their party’s headquarters.  Did they aspire to this obvious plan &#8211; did they bollocks!  They did   move their operation to Cumbria though, but sadly that’s were the clarity and openness ends, and they left a trail of debt behind them.  In terms of being honest it seems; it doesn&#8217;t appear to be the BNP’s most redeeming feature. </p>
<p>They choose another low key industrial estate for their European Office, unit 3B to be precise, and again they forgot that all important sign outside.  Sound odd to you &#8211; I’d say it sounds a tad shady.  But there’s more…  Then they moved their National Office into unit 3A next door, where at some point it’s claimed, the electric was siphoned from their Euro office.  Can you smell smoke?</p>
<p>All claims of the financial irregularities have been denied and this leaves the leader of the British Nazi Party with an unblemished record, for now.  You could he’s whiter than white, I won’t but you could.  So, the date of this text is 00/00/00 let’s see how long it takes the police to catch up with Mr Griffin and his east end tactics, it can’t be long now surely, I’ll give it another 12 months.</p>
<p>On paper, the BNP was technically in solvent in 2009, and again this has been denied by their Fuhrer.  He claims the current accusations have been brought about by former party members with an axe to grind.  Well, if I’d been held hostage in a van in a Tesco’s car park, I think I’d be pretty pissed off! </p>
<p>Another question you have to ask yourself is, who would you choose to be the party treasurer?  Surely you’d make enquiries with one of the many reputable finance organizations &#8211; but no, Mr Griffin chose to employ a former bouncer and lard specialist instead! </p>
<p>Is it any wonder then, after a 27 year run, the BNP are down to just 10 counsellors  and their membership figures are dropping by the day…</p>

<p>Well it’s been just over six months since Japan was hit by an earthquake, and the Daiichi nuclear plant was awash with copious amounts of extra sea water.  As the initial disaster has been out of the news for a while, you might assume that all is well in the orient.  You’d be out of your tiny mind you, but you could!  So let’s have a recap and see if you still fancy a nice long holiday in Fukushima&#8230;       </p>
<p>11<sup>th </sup>of March, 2011, the facts: it was a sunny day at the nuclear plant where everything was ticking along nicely.  Then WALLOP, a magnitude 9 earthquake shattered part of Japan and this was followed by a 40m tsunami, two natural catastrophes one after another. </p>
<p>The first two disasters alone wiped out 20,000 people in one hit, and destroyed 125,000 buildings.  The quake was so powerful it lowered the coastline by one metre and shunted Japan two metres closer to the USA!  On the upside, think how much aviation fuel will be saved by the airlines, tickets will be cheaper for a start! </p>
<p>Anyway, you’d think that would be enough destruction for one day but no &#8211; enter disaster three.  The tsunami headed for the nuclear plant, which went on to cause the multiple meltdown of three reactors.  This intern released more radiation into the atmosphere than any accident since the Chernobyl debacle.  Now, everything’s ginger and peachy, according the Japanese Government, but is it? </p>
<p>If parts of Chernobyl are still fenced off and uninhabitable, 25 years later, how can Fukushima be safe six months on?  If I didn&#8217;t know better I’d say someone is telling porkies to up the country’s cash flow again!</p>
<p>Still, always keen to take in all sides of a story, here’s what the powers at be and the locals say.  The government and the power company say the area is safe.  But the locals say so much information has been withheld they no longer trust them.  Sound familiar?  </p>
<p>And as plain as day here’s why the locals have lost faith.  Ministers have admitted holding back <strong>vital</strong> information in order to prevent a panic.  (That old chestnut)  What that really means is, if there was a panic it would cause problems when notifying the rich and powerful and moving them to safety first. </p>
<p>The day after the earthquake, there was an explosion in the No 1 reactor.  A couple of day’s later; reactor three blew its stack, and the very next morning there were blasts at reactors two and four.  </p>
<p>These explosions released a plume of radiation, but the government <strong>withheld</strong>projections of its size and how it spread up and down the coast and inland to Fukushima city, Koriyama and Tokyo.  The call went out and the statement to the plebs was, “Dear peasants, there is no immediate risk to human health.”  This was an enormous great fib boys and girls.          </p>
<p>The full details of what occurred at the reactor site are still emerging and they are far from complete, and here’s why.  Government spokesmen initially denied there was a meltdown.  Safety authorities ranked the accident at a mere four on the international scale of nuclear cock-ups.</p>
<p>Not until a month later did it upgrade this to a maximum seven &#8211; like Chernobyl.  Fibbing on an enormous scale children!  Well okay, let’s just sweep the death/loss of <strong>20,000</strong> people and the damage to a mere <strong>125.000</strong> buildings under a carpet for a moment, which is probably where they’ll stay, and take a look at what’s happening today.</p>
<p>You wouldn&#8217;t know there’d been a catastrophe; the whole area has been cleaned up.  But dig a little deeper and the changes are there.  Umbrella sales peaked due to the poisonous <strong>black rain</strong>that fell after the explosions, and Geiger counters are selling like hot cakes that have been eradiated and are still warm!  And the local food well, most food clicks doesn&#8217;t it!  The good news, no-one in the contaminated areas will need an X-ray for the foreseeable future.          </p>
<p>Clearly the safety goalposts have been moved and the nuclear figures received a thorough massaging, because what was deemed dangerous 12 months ago is now considered safe and legal?  This leaves nearly 2 million residents living in areas where the annual radiation dose exceeds the safety target set by the government!  Someone should at least write a stiff letter don&#8217;t you think! </p>
<p>Even in Tokyo – <strong>240km</strong> from the reactors – levels have risen near to a stage where they would’ve been marked with a radiation hazard warning if they were found in a workplace.  Nice!</p>
<p>So, now the dust has settled and the top 50cm of soil has been removed by bulldozers, another set of invisible disasters is emerging.  Yes, as usual, it’ll be the cannon fodder of society, the workers who will show the true toll of a disaster such as this. </p>
<p>Now there’s a psychological crisis, which you can assume will go on cause uncertainty and depression amongst the survivors.  Most of the local farmers are in despair about their contaminated soil.  The young people are leaving, and in the past six months there’s been an increase in suicides.   </p>
<p>Unlike an earthquake survivors don’t suffer with post-traumatic stress symptoms of insomnia, shaking and flashbacks.  Instead, the radiation creates a slow, creeping, invisible pressure that can lead to prolonged depression.  Some people say they want to die and others become more dependent on alcohol and many more will complain of listlessness.</p>
<p>But, don’t fret, don’t get down or depressed, all naughty nuclear tackle can be sucked out of the air and heavily contaminated soil with… SUNFLOWERS!</p>
<p>They’re everywhere now.  Is it going to help?  I can’t see it personally, but hey, it will brighten up Fukushima until they have to burn the stalks and petals releasing the concentrated radioactivity back into the environment!  Call me old fashioned, but isn&#8217;t time to ditch the nuclear nonsense…</p>
<p>Can you hear clicking&#8230;</p>

<p>I knew exactly what he was thinking, but he still persisted in ignoring me, so I stormed past the front of the bus like a bull that’d just snagged his wedding tackle on the crossbar of his Rally Chopper, and just before I crossed the road I glared at the operator menacingly.  I even had time to flick though London Transport’s book of ‘How to Piss off a Passenger’. </p>
<p>On page nineteen, appendix iiii, it states: if a driver makes no eye contact with a passenger at any time they don’t exist!  As luck would have it, the temporary lights held up the queue of traffic that bus was sitting in for over five minutes, giving me more than enough time to reach the next stop.  I light up a cigarette and waited in a smug repose for my quarry to pull up.</p>
<p>He rounded the corner and cruised towards me &#8211; change in hand and smiling inwardly I hailed once more.  Bastard sailed right passed me again!  I uttered many expletives in the direction of the vanishing bus, mostly beginning with the letters C, F, W and B, but overall I’d say it was the C word that gained the most attention!  I was so incensed I took his number, it was a 67!  I thought, fuck this for a game of soldiers, I’ll write a stiff letter to London Transport’s complaints department, but I couldn’t find a shop that sold stiff paper! </p>
<p>A swearing fit lasting way past the 60 second mark ensued; and I began cursing again when I notice that some arse had placed yet another decommissioned sign at the very top of the second bus stop.  When I realised how far away the next bus stop was I blew my stack for a third time, I mean I went absolutely ape-shit.  I kicked the shelter, the bin that no one uses, the seating arrangement and finally the bus stop itself, mainly because it had the words, ‘bus stop’ on it!</p>
<p>As is always is the case when you’re mid-thrombi, I’d lost the focus of my surroundings, and it wasn&#8217;t until I turned round to light up the obligatory stress fag that I realised I was standing about 10 feet from a primary school.  My explosive outburst had neatly coincided with chucking out time and the playground was full of children, parents and an entourage of teachers. </p>
<p>Heads, small and large, began turning in my direction as motherly hands cupped their little cherub’s ears.  Oooops!  Still in full fuming mode; I power-walked the 500 yards to next stop.  I know it was that far because I counted every one of my steps.  There was some good news, however, as I stomped my way between the two waiting zones not one single red lorry passed me.  I arrived at the next stop and joined a group of hopeful travellers who, by the looks of it, had suffered a similar transport fate.</p>
<p>Looking for a positive angle, I consoled myself with the fact that at least it had stopped raining.  In fact, the weather conditions were quite the reverse.  There was so much ultra violet light flying about I couldn’t see bloody thing when I looked back up the road behind me. </p>
<p>Thanks to just the right amount of surface water, left from the downpour earlier, there was a wash of dazzling sunlight, and it was bouncing off the tarmac in the road, the pavement, every window in the street, and off of the slate tiles of the houses too.  You couldn’t even see the general through traffic it just appeared out of what can only be described as Haringey’s first Stargate. </p>
<p>Twenty minutes or more had passed, and there was still no sign of a bus, but, when a few of the passengers at the head of the queue adopted the posture of a Meer Kat’s lookout, it caused a stir of hope; I even made a grab for my fare.  It was the kiss of death.  What pulled up?  The only other bus on the route, and it didn’t go anywhere near where I wanted to go!  I was so happy for the crowd that got on the bus! </p>
<p>A newer set of minutes past and another 341 snaked its way up to the stop and, in the space of the next 10 minutes, two more went by.  There was no doubt about it &#8211; I was starting to take this personally!  I knew I was, because my fare was starting to melt in my hand! </p>
<p>Out of the blue, and in the midst of a cloud of hatred of bus drivers all over the world, came a stirring amongst the remaining crowd.  It could mean only one thing, the approach of another red lorry.  After a group hug and swift prayer I flicked my fag butt to the kerb and looked up and there it was &#8211; a beautiful bright shiny 67. </p>
<p>A group of Christians in the queue broke into a chorus of, “When Jesus walked,” and prayer mats bedecked the pavement but the rejoicing was short lived.  Yes it was a forward moving 67 and yes there were passengers within.  It didn&#8217;t have a, &#8216;sorry out of service&#8217;, sign on it and no, it wasn&#8217;t about to break down. </p>
<p>If I didn&#8217;t know better, I’d say you waiting for the ‘but’ aren&#8217;t you?  Well, here it comes.  All of the upbeat emotions, which included relief, were slashed to ribbons when a cockney Asian driver opened the bus doors and shouted out, “Oi, oi saveloy, everybody off.  The bus terminates ‘ere.” </p>
<p>Tambourines, triangles, pan pipes and sheet music all hit the deck in unison.  I&#8217;ve never felt anger spread so quickly amongst a small group of people before; I mean you could actually see the waves of hate washing over the bus. </p>
<p>Here’s just a sample of what the crowd thought of the driver and his informative speech, after standing around for over an hour.  “C**t, c**t, c**t, c**t, c**t, c**t, c**t, poo, blast and…, buff-oon.”  Well seven of our party were nuns after all!  I’d left the head clinic with hope in my heart, and glee in my knees, at the thought of a swift return home, as it was I managed to scrape home two an a half hours later!  After a day of recuperation, I wrote my letter of complaint and it read… </p>
<p>Dear Transport Minister,</p>
<p>Could you please take the entire London Transport system and stick it up your dirt box or, at the very least, use the bloody shambles to find out how ineffective it is when you actually need to get from A to B in the same day.</p>
<p>Yours, sincerely hacked-off of Tottenham</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p> </p>
<p>A true story&#8230;</p>
<p>Well we&#8217;ve all used it, and deep down we know it’s largely unsatisfying, so why do we go back for more?  The simple answer is, if you’re minus a car you’re forced to use London Transport’s red lorry service.  Oh don’t get me wrong, they’re a bloody marvel if you haven’t got to be anywhere particular at a specific time, but my advice is, give yourself half a chance and leave the day before!</p>
<p>I’d received a letter from the hospital saying that I needed take a blood test for my Lithium levels, and I also had an appointment with my psychiatrist.  I was dreading it.  Not the meeting or the visit to the vampire suite, the journey!  It meant that I’d be at the mercy of three different bus routes, using six buses in all &#8211; in short, a bus traveller’s nightmare. </p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t a cheap trip either; LT had just increased their fares.  Some twat in a suit had come up with the brilliant idea of a blanket charge which meant that even if you only went one stop you still had to fork out two quid, so my round trip cost a small fortune. </p>
<p>By car, the hospital was literally no more than a 10 minute drive, but I didn&#8217;t have a car at the time so I was stuck with the situation.  And to makes things even less appealing when I checked back over some rough figure work I saw that, even if you took into consideration the bus mileage and timescale, it would&#8217;ve still been quicker to book a short haul flight!</p>
<p>So I turned up at the place where the big red lorries were supposed to pick you up.  If you haven’t had the privilege of using this form of transport, the object of the game is this in brief.  You, the ever hopeful traveller, hang around for anything up to an hour in all weathers. </p>
<p>If you’re lucky, you’ll find a bus shelter but there’s no point in using it as it’s been built with no sides.  When the bus does finally arrive, you board and hand over a small portion of your life savings, and for this you get thrown around for half an hour by the guy sitting behind the safety cage, and if you’re really lucky you’ll get dropped off roughly 600 hundred yards from where you actually want to be!</p>
<p>After just a few moments of waiting, my first bus turned up, and to my total surprise, we made the first leg of the journey in a reasonable time.  I disembarked and my fingers went straight for my cigarettes, as there was no way the second bus would turn up straight away.  I’d just inhaled a lung full of quality tobacco smoke when heads began to turn at the stop and, sure enough, the second licensed bandit was approaching.  This miracle was repeated at the third stop. </p>
<p>Unbelievable &#8211; staggering even, and up until that point in my travel history unheard of, so I arrived at the bonce department with plenty of time to spare.  I went straight in for my blood test, as there was no one else waiting, and my meeting with the head doctor was over in 15 minutes.  I hit the road at 3.20 pm exactly, with the hope that my return journey would be a swift as my arrival… more chance of being ravaged by a brace of nuns dressed in nurse’s uniforms! </p>
<p>For one single solitary minute, I did toy with the idea of calling a cab.  I had the money in my pocket, which was about the same as the bus fare, and there was a phone in the hospital’s reception with a cab company’s number to hand.  But I thought no, I’ll entrust my faith in the big red lorry network once more.  What a bloody idiot!</p>
<p>On leaving the brain factory I could see my first homeward bound bus heading my way and could only assume that every one of my stars were in perfect alignment that day.  Then a negative thought crossed my mind, I hadn&#8217;t a clue <span style="text-decoration: underline;">where</span> to hail down my<strong> </strong>nine ton people carrier, as the council had seen fit to dig up the road that day.  </p>
<p>But I needn&#8217;t have worried as, behind me was a fully functioning stopper of buses minus its shelter, reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-sult!  I stuck my arm out casually and waited for the comforting sounds of air brakes and a hiss that said, “The doors are open mate, step inside.”  Bastard drove straight past me!</p>
<p>I was immediately filled with a sense of rage which was unusual for me, but before I began shouting the odds I thought I’d better check the timetable to make sure it was on the route I needed, and it was.  My sense of loathing elevated swiftly to a hate status.  But, what I’d failed to see was a small yellow notice at the top of the bus stop which said the stop was out of use due to the road works. </p>
<p>Now at this stage the transport for the poor was held up by a set of temporary traffic lights about fifty yards away and, as these types of lights generally take longer to change than the fixed variety, I figured I had enough time to walk up to the bus and see if the caring sharing son-of-a-bitch would let me on. </p>
<p>From my position on the pavement I could see the driver, and I knew that he knew I was there, but he’d obviously been flicking through London Transport’s conduct manual to discover how to deal with the, ‘angry client standing outside his bus.’ </p>
<p>On page nine there are just two short paragraphs.  The first says, “Just drive off.”  And the second states that, “If you find yourself stuck in traffic for any length of time start playing the ‘looking straight ahead game’ &#8211; and then drive off.”  I extended a friendly wave.  Did he offer to open the doors even though he wasn&#8217;t at a stop, but there was clearly plenty of time for me to board without causing an accident?  Did he bollocks!</p>
<p>I was more than a little pissed off to say the least, but in the distance I could see a glimmer of hope, about a hundred and fifty yards away was another hailing post.  A couple of minutes had ticked by at this stage, so I decided to make my move, especially as I could see that the driver was beginning to lose his cool. </p>
<p>Oh yes, even though his head was fixed in a facing forward position his body language was beginning to let him down.  There was much gripping and un-gripping of the steering wheel, and from time to time he’d roll his head from side to side in attempt to relieve the stress in his neck.  Boo-wa-ha-ha!</p>
<p>Final part next week&#8230;</p>
