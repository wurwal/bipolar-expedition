				<small>May 29th, 2011 <!-- by Neil --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p> </p>
<p>It&#8217;s taken an inordinate amount of time to persuade the Government to take up my radical suggestion to eradicate obesity in the UK, but finally, last week the Health Minister asked me to attend a meeting&#8230;</p>
<p>I opened the debate with what we we&#8217;re given when we were born, i.e. two eyes, legs, arms and so on.  And, overall, I don&#8217;t think the board members grasped what I was trying to achieve.  Then I pointed out that, we as humans, haven&#8217;t evolved sufficiently to cope with the rubbish that food producers add to the food we buy and eat. </p>
<p>Hydrogenated fat, for example.  If you saw it in its natural state, you wouldn&#8217;t eat it, you&#8217;d start hanging wallpaper up with it.  But, use it bind apple and blackcurrant together, and slap some pastry around it, and you&#8217;d quite happily let your kids eat it.</p>
<p>In short, to solve the UK&#8217;s bloater problem we have to cut through the red tape, &#8216;cut&#8217; being the operative word, and start producing a new race of people who will go on to use less bodily parts, and in so-doing reduce the obesity crisis and everything that comes with being a lard-arse.  And the answer &#8211; the simple act of surgical removal.  </p>
<p>Oh yes, it sounds a drastic approach, but is it?  I personally have to disagree.  Imagine, one of your children is ill, a high fever perhaps.  You head off to the hospital only to find there&#8217;s a five hour wait, and all because a string of porkers are in the queue ahead of you, suffering from high blood pressure, diabetes or time consuming heart attacks!  With my new system, you won&#8217;t have to line up ever again, you&#8217;ll be able to stroll straight in and be seen within minutes of entering the hospital.</p>
<p>So what do we do?  Well, first I publish a copy of my next book &#8216;If you don&#8217;t need it &#8211; cut it off&#8217;, then start interviewing  podgester couples who haven&#8217;t as yet had children.  Then I would brief them on the possibilities of living without that extra vital organ, while pointing out that having ten toes isn&#8217;t really a necessity! </p>
<p>Once they see the benefits of my scheme and agree to a few minor operations well, 23 at a bear minimum, people will be queuing up around the block to take part in this great venture.  In the years ahead of course, this surgery won&#8217;t be needed, as the child of the future will be born without the extra parts.  </p>
<p>If you can think, &#8221; Hey, why do I need that extra lung,&#8221; things will have a more positive edge.  So, the master plan is in place, and here&#8217;s roughly the extent of my work to date, which was undertaken during a lock-in at &#8216;Glass blower&#8217;s Gusset&#8217;.  Noses.  Well we can shave those off, you&#8217;ll still have two holes to breath through, and you&#8217;ll be 2ozs lighter straight away!  Ears.  Again, lop those puppies off and you&#8217;re well on your way to losing your first pound in weight.</p>
<p>Lose a buttock, and be the envy of all your friends, and 5lbs lighter too!  The added advantage  here of course is that when you have a fitting for your next pair of trousers, you won&#8217;t so much material, and consequently your clothes will be much cheaper.  It really is a win-win situation!  Why stop there, pull that bonus eye out, and get the remaining one moved to the centre of your forehead!</p>
<p>Tonsils?  Rip &#8217;em out mate.  Spleen?  Ditto.  Nipples?  Completely wasted on a bloke, and hey, who needs a whole liver?  Cut the bugger in half and shed another couple of pounds in an instant.  And while we&#8217;re at it, let&#8217;s take out that spare kidney too.  Do you use all of your brain?  No.  Well there you are then, keep what you need and bin the rest!  Yes, I reckon I&#8217;ve managed to shift around 12lbs of unwanted weight there, without even blinking.</p>
<p>Looking at the bigger picture, who ever it was that designed the human form, can&#8217;t be credited with creating the most intricate being on our planet.   I mean, most people haven&#8217;t spotted the most obvious flaw in our complex design.  Think about it &#8211; who in their right mind would fit a waste disposal unit, right next to a communal play area??? </p>

					<p> </p>
<p>Well it&#8217;s a bit like camping.  Seven days of it and you can&#8217;t wait to get home to a comfortable bed&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking, of course, about hiring a boat and setting sail on the river Thames.  It did seem like a great idea at the time, but come the middle of the week I&#8217;d had enough.  I&#8217;m not sure what tipped the balance in my mind, the boredom of travelling at speeds that a snail would laugh at or the fact that I fell in at a mooring site, just before a lock, which left me with half a pound of small stones embedded in my heel.  Looking back now, as a 23 year old, it was the whole cycle of the trip wore me down in the end. </p>
<p>Overall, it seems all to easy to hire a boat and set off down or up the river, depending where you start.  All I can recall was a little chubster of a marine owner saying, &#8220;Thanks for the cash, here&#8217;s the key, there&#8217;s your boat and see you in a week!&#8221;  The rest was up to us!  So, after stowing our belongings away and sparking up the engine of HMS Intrepid, the four of us headed off in search of the nearest pub.</p>
<p>However, before you make to the nearest inn, like life, there are a certain amount of  obstacles, barriers if you will, that are set to fuck up your transit towards a clutch of decent pints of bitter.  Opening you first lock is a fascinating exercise.  You don&#8217;t know what to do, but people appear out of nowhere to help.  But, by lock 315, you really don&#8217;t give a shit, especially after you&#8217;ve worked out that if you had a straight run, with no locks, you could add another two days to your holiday.         </p>
<p>Were we warned about accidents that may occur on our journey?  &#8220;Key, boat, see you next week.&#8221;  If we were I&#8217;d missed it!  At one point my girlfriend took the wheel and all was fine for quite some time.  That was until we entered a private yachting marina.  Rather than alert the crew of any impending doom, my lady-love kept schtum, hoping she could sneak out the same way she stumbled into the boating equivalent of a Rolls Royce showroom. </p>
<p>And the plan worked, right up until the point where something long and expensive looking, which was sticking out proud of another boat, made contact with the side of our boat.  There was this sort of straining noise, which was followed by an unnerving scraping sound.  I woke up to find part of an aluminium mast making an entrance through a window which then made contact with the frame of the window. </p>
<p>I watched as out boat lurched forward, instead of the intended direction of reverse, and heard the cries of a young female in distress saying, &#8220;Bollocks, fuck it,&#8221; and, &#8220;bollocks,&#8221; once more!  I&#8217;m not quite sure how we slipped away unnoticed, baring in mind the row that the collision made, plus the level of human vocal activity, but some how we did.  And the damage?  Well we couldn&#8217;t shut our window now.  And the yacht&#8217;s mast?  Personally I thought the bend at the tip of it lent it a certain amount of charm!             </p>
<p>A few days into our voyage we met up with boaters and punts brigade.  It was all very Pimms and jolly nice dresses, if you know what I mean.  Bloody idiots &#8211; loads of money, but a sad lack of common sense.  Thank God we had missed the Henley Regatta by exactly one week, these prats were just the warm-up act.</p>
<p>Did anyone mention anything about the boat&#8217;s engine?  &#8220;Key, boat, bye.&#8221;  Nope, don&#8217;t think so.  On the Thursday there was this smell.  A smell which smelt like if it could speak wouldv&#8217;e said, WARNING &#8211; WARNING &#8211; WILL ROBINSON -YOU&#8217;RE ENGINE IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE.  But it didn&#8217;t.  So, after waiting for five hours for it to cool down, we thought we had better put some lubricant in the oil-starved engine.  </p>
<p>The very next day we managed to beach our trusty puddle steamer on a sandbank.  Aah yes, the joys of standing at the helm, while sailing into the midday sun with a blinding hangover.   Fortunately the crew of a tourist boat alerted their man at the wheel, and he shouted at us to wait for the backwash of his cruiser while slamming our wreck in reverse.</p>
<p>I think the main reason the trip wore me down to a frazzle were to key points.  The first was the chemical toilet.  Man, it was toxic in there.  And that was before anyone had used it.  For tuppence I&#8217;d have had a dump over the side, but you know what it&#8217;s like, you just can&#8217;t go when a bunch of canoeists paddle past or a gaggle of cyclists drift by on the tow path can you! </p>
<p>Well, by day six you&#8217;re completely pissed off with life on a boat.  The bog stinks to high heaven, the fly and mosquito population seems to have tripled, and you&#8217;ve totally run out of patience with anything to do with the lock gates.  However, one thing you&#8217;re not going to miss is, parking up at night.  You&#8217;re tired, you can&#8217;t be arsed to cook, and all you want to do is hit the nearest pub.  But can you find a mooring site?  Can you bollocks!  You can see plenty of spaces, but can you reach them before a German U Boat slips in before you?  NOT AT 8 FUCKING MILES PER HOUR YOU CAN&#8217;T!!!!  They already had their towels down at 2:30 in the afternoon!  </p>
<p>You disembark, making sure you pull up with the damaged window facing away from the landing stage, and say to the boat owner, &#8220;Key, boat, and &#8211; by,&#8221; then run like hell to your car, hoping the bloke with the aluminium mast hasn&#8217;t rung the guy demanding money with menecies.  NO, NO, NO &#8211;  NEVER , EVER AGAIN </p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p> </p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m sure every country in the world has at least one idiot like this tucked away somewhere, but how they end up presenting their own television program, week after week, is beyond me&#8230;</p>
<p>We, here in jolly old England, have the shy, retiring and very placid woodsman, Ray &#8216;yawn, yawn and thrice yawn&#8217; Mears.  And, what he doesn&#8217;t know about surviving out in the wild, could be carved on a soldier ant&#8217;s bog seat &#8211; but God he&#8217;s a boring old fart!  And consequently about as stimulating as a waterlogged firework that went out for a walk in the rain, minus an umbrella, and dressed in a matching two-piece sponge ensemble.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s been absolutely everywhere and filmed his exploits and, and he gets paid for it &#8211; unbelievable!  It&#8217;s just a shame he had a personality bypass before his woodcraft career began.  Yes, he has an extensive range of knowledge, and yes, you could dump him anywhere on the planet, with no more than a knotted handkerchief and a quarter dolly mixtures, and he&#8217;ll survive.  But really, what&#8217;s the bloody point?</p>
<p>Am I going to face a grizzly bear in north London or find myself dehydrated while walking up my local high street?  No, is the short answer to that.  His wife must be on the verge of a break-down I should think.  He can rub two boy scouts to start a fire, but he can&#8217;t work out how to turn on the bloody central heating &#8211; twat! </p>
<p>And he&#8217;s clearly forgotten what a supermarket looks like, because his wife asked him to go out and get something for an evening meal and he came back with a bag of wild mushrooms, [well, livid actually], a brace of hornet&#8217;s breasts, and two haunches of road kill.  (Species still unverified.)</p>
<p>Mrs &#8216;Oh no, soppy bollocks has gone walk-about again&#8217; Mears can&#8217;t even ask him to do any housework either.  Last week he took all the washing down to a local river and started battering it against a rock.  It was a great effort on his part, and three days later everything was spotlessly clean.  Unfortunately, every item of clothing was full of holes and still wet.</p>
<p>And he hasn&#8217;t got a clue how to use any electrical goods you know!  His better half asked him to tackle the vacuuming a few days ago, while she went to work.  She came home to find him using the &#8216;Cyclone Vortex Carpet Sucker 4000; only to discover that Nanook of the north hadn&#8217;t plugged it in!  And the other day he said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry love, I&#8217;ll make the beds,&#8221; and when she returned from the psychiatrists, he&#8217;d chopped them up, made a canoe, and erected hammocks in every room.  But, to do this, he&#8217;d pulled up six fir trees from the garden to tie them too.  What a spanner! </p>
<p>It&#8217;s the film crew I feel sorry for, they have to eat what he cooks at the end of a very long day.  Imagine the scene.  You&#8217;ve just sat down after hours of listening to him banging on about the benefits of eating cuckoo spit soup, and you&#8217;re hoping for a plateful of steak and chips and a few beers, and what do you get &#8211; a starter of bluebells and bat droppings, a main course that could range from anything from a stickleback sandwich to a slice of woodpecker&#8217;s bum en croute, followed by a dollop of vole and mint ice cream.  Well, whoop-de-bloody-do!</p>
<p>Of course, having all the knowledge of woodcraft under your belt and surviving in the elements, even though you have a perfectly comfortable home, is just part of the irony.  His documentaries are maticulously planned out before he sets off.  So, if you&#8217;re a first-timer, this is what you would need to survive in the Gobi desert for one night:</p>
<p>one four-man camera crew and a fully laden 4 x 4, (50 grand should cover that).  You might want to take a small tanker of water too, oh, and a bucket of anti snake bite venom.  Now all you need to do is arrange transportation for all of the above, book some first class air tickets, find £200,000 to pay for it, and you&#8217;re good to go!  Now, call me cynical but, it&#8217;s hardly roughing it, is it?  That a holiday!</p>
<p>&#8220;Always carry a parachute with you,&#8221; he says  What!  Even when you go to the dentist?  Now, when I wake up in the morning, my main priorities are, my first cigarette of the day and how quickly I can make that first all important cup of tea.  When Ray wakes up his first thoughts are, &#8220;Why am I covered in owl droppings again.&#8221; and, &#8220;Suppose I better start a fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>No wonder he hasn&#8217;t got a proper job, it takes him too long to produce anything.  He arrives on site, somewhere in the Amazon rain forest, with nothing more than a knotted handkerchief and an axe and, first things first, he has to build a shelter.  Well there&#8217;s two hours of your life you&#8217;ll never see again!  So, after hanging up his hammock and covering it with a mosquito net, off he trots to find something to eat, while looking for the 16 basic types of wood you need to start the fire in the first place.  Personally, I&#8217;d smash up that chair I made!  Bang goes another two bloody hours!</p>
<p>So, after foraging in the undergrowth you find your quarry.  Usually some poisonous berries or roots, which need to be boiled in water to remove the toxins, and then you set about lighting your fire.  And, as if by magic 16 hours later, your evening meal is ready.  And what does he say to camera, with an inane look of his face?  &#8220;My, that&#8217;s tasty,&#8221; as he chomps his way through a billycan of brown mush that you wouldn&#8217;t give to a guinea pig.  Well he&#8217;s going to say that isn&#8217;t he, he&#8217;s bloody starving!</p>
<p>Moving on, if you&#8217;re spending time under the stars in the Grand Canyon, keep an eye out for anything with teeth and claws that weighs around 800 pounds, and could be between 5 and 8 feet tall &#8211; it&#8217;s probably just be a grizzly bear.  And here are a few of &#8216;Davy Crockett&#8217;s top tips to avoid be eaten: don&#8217;t visit the Grand Cayon.  Never offer it a sandwich, and stay calm, even though the compulsion to change into a pair of brown corduroys is the first thing on your mind.</p>
<p>Can you play dead?  Yes, but personally, I&#8217;m all in favour of of the odds of running like fuck in the opposite direction, despite being informed by Mr Mears that you shouldn&#8217;t!  Should you attempted to climb the nearest tree?  If you think it will help.  But I should warn you, as big as they are; even bears aren&#8217;t adverse to shinning up up a silver birch for a spot of lunch!  </p>
<p>The final piece of usless advice from our intrepid twit is, always stay down wind from the bears.  Well that&#8217;s just great.  What if they&#8217;re behind you?  Bloody idiot!  Right, I&#8217;m off, my slug and humming bird pizza has just arrived&#8230;</p>
<p>[observation: 630 episodes I&#8217;ve watched, and not once did he make a toilet &#8211; the dirty, dirty devil!]</p>

<p>The debate continues between vehicles insurers as to whether they will cover giraffes against whiplash.  A giraffe at London zoo said last week, &#8220;It&#8217;s not fair, I&#8217;ve got a mate in Bristol zoo, and he managed to get covered, it&#8217;s neckism pure and simple.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the first time since 1749, lisps will be legalised in Wales today.  The courts have tried to make lisps legal in the past, but due to the amount of sylvia produced by by the Welsh when they speak, the ink kept smudging on the paper leaving the terms of the court papers  illedgable.   However, since the invention of laminated paper, the ruling should be passed next week. </p>
<p>And due to pressure from the European Union, New Scotland Yard will forced to change its name.  A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said, &#8220;It&#8217;s sad day for us, for years it was known as Great Scotland Yard, then Scotland Yard, now it&#8217;s going to be called New Scotland Metre, and all becuse we went metric!&#8221;</p>

<p>If CDs were square, you&#8217;d have to cut the corners off to get them in your player &#8211; fact</p>
<p>Local Sport now&#8230; All of the Enfield Narcoleptic&#8217;s11 were booked last Saturday for time wasting in a friendly against the Barnet  Somnambulist.  Their manager said last night, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe this has happened agai&#8230;.zzzzzzzzz zzz zzzzzzz.&#8221; </p>
