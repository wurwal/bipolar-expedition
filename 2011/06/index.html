<p>Well, I&#8217;ve seen pictures of people doing it, and I understand that hundreds of groups do it every weekend; my only thought on the matter is why they would undertake this ridiculous pastime on a regular basis so blatantly?  I’m talking, of course, about the ramblers of the UK.</p>
<p>I mean, the facts and figures speak for themselves, but I believe that almost all of these strolling buffoons have a mental illness that’s gone undiagnosed for decades.  And, you know you’re in trouble when the ramblers of this green and pleasant land have organised &#8211; an association!</p>
<p>Can you imagine what the head office is like?  A bunch of knitty-Norah&#8217;s, who only listen to Radio Four, are regular church goers and sponsor unknown animal groups from an undiscovered continent on Mars.   Then you have the local groups to contend with, and I can assure you these off-shoots from the main vein will be far worse than the main HQ.</p>
<p>There will be some self-appointed arse and a begrudging wife taking the lead in all cases.  He will decide everything in the group because he had a high-powered job in organising plebs and he’s used to pushing people about and getting his own way.</p>
<p>So, you&#8217;ve joined a local ramblers group and you&#8217;ve worked out internal hierarchy and now you&#8217;ve got to buy yourself  some gear.  Yes, aside from socks, trousers, gloves, boots, a hat, (all water and wind proof I might add), and a walking stick that walks, you&#8217;ll need a pedometer.  Quite why you would want to take a pervert with you is beyond me!  </p>
<p>And to complete the list of requirements you need to put one foot in front of the other, you’re going to have to shell out for: a ruck sack big enough to carry an eight-man hurricane tent, a stretcher, at least one iron lung machine, a first-aid kit and possibly a two-seater kayak!  Well, you have to take into account the dangerous aspects of WALKING!!! </p>
<p>You may be interested to know that you will also be required to take along with you, a bunch of maps, a compass, at least two theodolites, breakfast, dinner and a high tea, a thermos flask for a hot drink, and at least 20 litres of water, along with your over trousers or gaiters.  Well, it’s a hazardous hobby this walking malarkey, deadly in some cases.</p>
<p>Of 39,407 people killed or very, very seriously killed on Britain’s roads in 2002, 8,631 were people who walked about a bit.  And what was the cost of the pedestrian road accident casualties in Britain?  Well, the knock down, rock bottom price is £2.4 billion big ones a year!</p>
<p>A prat or novice walker, usually between the ages of 16 and 32 may try to use a sat nav system if they’re lost.  After all, they know exactly where you are and can take you to where you want to be.  This is bollocks.  In all cases the outcome of using such a device will result in death due to starvation and dehydration or discovering you&#8217;ve made it to France, much the same thing really.</p>
<p>I can safely say that, second to potholing, I can’t think of a more selfish and costly pastime than walking a bit and then getting lost of injured.  And all because a rambling cell somewhere in the grimy underworld of Croydon, London enrolled a bunch of fresh-air freaks and radicalised them into believing that they have a right to roam!!!</p>
<p>The cost of finding the daft bastards runs into the thousands each year, and in this country I’m sure the NHS has better things to spend its money on quite frankly.  “Quick, quick, there’s a man who’s injured himself after falling off of a molehill.”  Well worth calling out a fleet of ambulances for!  Meanwhile, somewhere in the centre of town, where you don’t need to be a map reader or rely on grid references, is someone&#8217;s mother who’s fallen down the stairs and had a heart attack!!!  Personally, I&#8217;d shoot all ramblers at birth.</p>

				<h2><a href="../../youve-never-had-it-so-good/index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to You&#8217;ve never had it so good">You&#8217;ve never had it so good</a></h2>

<p>Now, as far back as I can remember there has always been some form of equality for women in the British Isles.  It might have been as well balanced as the &#8216;little&#8217; lady liked, but at the bare minimum you would have a door opened for you on occasions&#8230;</p>
<p>In the fifties, mummy was brain-washed into believing that she had to do everything for her man, because that&#8217;s what the generation before did.  Thankfully, I&#8217;m glad say, that attitude has changed however, a certain faction of the female lady-partners will insist on moaning about their life-style choices, their partners eventually and why they haven&#8217;t got enough shoes, and more often that not it&#8217;s the male partner who cops the flak&#8230;</p>
<p>So, I appeal to the chaps to contact me with regard to this annoyance, and I will personally arrange a trip for any  nagging trouts, old and young, to see if I can help the nagees, and give the naggers something to think about.  And I thought I&#8217;d start with a six month break in Saudi Arabia, where they will live the life of a Saudi wife, just to see how they get on.</p>
<p>Now the first subject that may cause our British ladies some problems is the religious side of life.  Most serious out there, and largely in favour of the lads I feel.  And, perhaps this is due to the fact that the Saudi book of &#8216; This is how it&#8217;s gonna be&#8217; was alledgedley written by a bloke, much like our &#8216;rule book&#8217; of life. </p>
<p>But you know, I can&#8217;t recall seeing a clause in the C of E handbook where it states that: men are superior to women and are commanded to beat their wives if they are disobedient.  Moreover, when I went to Sunday school, (that&#8217;s attended, not forced to attended), I don&#8217;t remember our teacher saying that it would be absolutely tip-top to have as much rumpy-pumpy as I liked, with all of my wives and concubines, when I grew up.</p>
<p>Call me old fashioned, but it seems to me as if the rules change for the blokey-bloke-about-town depending on what country he happens to have been born in!  Okay, I was born in England, and maybe I am a bit of a softy, I really don&#8217;t give a toss.  At least I&#8217;m not a sexist pig who thinks he can control, beat and debase women just because a rather old book says I can.  Maybe, just maybe, these books should be updated, after all, EVERYTHING needs updating at some point doesn&#8217;t it!</p>
<p>In these far of lands, will your daughter be able to gain an education?  WHAT!  Why would you need one, when you have a bunch of men to tell you what to do for the rest of you natural life.  That&#8217;s assuming you tow the line and don&#8217;t get executed in the process.  In any case, you can&#8217;t go around being smarter than a man, what would his mates think?  I mean Jesus, if the ladies start thinking for themselves they&#8217;ll want to start driving cars on the strength of that! </p>
<p>Worse still &#8211; they might want to get a job!  Fuck that for a game of soldiers!  What ever next &#8211; conversations with men outside their family, while they&#8217;re completely unattended by a man from a man inside their family circle!!!  Good God, the whole fabric of society would break down.  No, no, I can see why you would need a strict rule to hid behind, especially if you wanted to suppress one section of the population, do what you like and have sex on tap.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s consider the breaking of rules for a moment.  That too seems to fall heavily to one side, the female side you maybe surprised to hear!  You may have just gone out to hang up the washing in the garden, you know, stepped out side of your house.  But did you ask for permission, more importantly, did you ask a man?  No!  Oh deary, deary me!  Well, let&#8217;s see what it says in the &#8216;good book&#8217; about that&#8230; no, before we start delving into how to recieve a damn good &#8216;scourging&#8217; (Flailed) by your loving hubby, let&#8217;s take a look at the punishment for the children.</p>
<p>Now I don&#8217;t care what background you&#8217;ve come from or how much money you&#8217;ve got in the bank, everyone during their formative years has nicked something, even if it was for a dare.  So how do you deal with this?  Well, every parent has a different approach depending on the details of this petty crime.  My dad gave me a damn stiff taking too, and that was enough to put me off a life of pilfering.  Let&#8217;s take in a few facts from the book of &#8216;This is how it&#8217;s gonna be&#8217;. </p>
<p>Not only do the laws state that women are not just second class citizens, half a man, at times their very exsistence is disregarded.  And someone pointed out that the ladies of Saudi have managed  to achieve equality in one field only: equal rights to imprisonment, exile, torture, being killed and now slaughter.  Well there you are, things are really moving forward now!!!  Is that, &#8220;I will survive,&#8221; playing in the background&#8230;</p>
<p>In the children&#8217;s department it seems that being punished, suddenly the more mature the female is, the more responsible they are for their actions.  Overall, less rights, more punishment &#8211; nice!  So, if you can imaging a scenario where a boy of 14 and a girl of 9 stole an item, here&#8217;s how it would pan out.  According to the laws the girl would lose four fingers on her right hand for a first offence.  On a second offence her left foot would be cut off, she would go to prison for a third offence and on a fourth occasion she would be executed!  Possibly a tad harsh.  The boy, on the other hand, with the missing digits, would go Scott free. </p>
<p>Sounds like a great place to live &#8211; if you&#8217;re a bloke&#8230;  Still think your life&#8217;s crap?</p>

<p>You have to realise that when you are one, you tend not to take any notice of it, but it&#8217;s not until you get a little older that you realise you&#8217;ve been repressed from day one&#8230;</p>
<p>I can remember my mum telling me that when she was at school the pupils that were had to sit on theirs, because it went against the grain of what was seen as normality.  Well that&#8217;s just bloody typical of the masses isn&#8217;t it!  What a start in life.  As if the first day at the higher seat of learning wasn&#8217;t bad enough, some arse notices that you&#8217;re left-handed!</p>
<p>Thankfully, more and more people are aware of the problems of living in a predominantly right-handed world.  Not that a right handed person would take much notice.  Well I say, give &#8217;em a left-handed cheque book and a pair of scissors to play with for a week and see how they get on!  And once they&#8217;ve mastered those seemingly innocent objects, put them in a room with a left-handed ruler and a spud peeler!  [Dear lefties, I&#8217;ll bet my next week&#8217;s wages that at this point the right-handed amongst are looking at each other with a quizzical look on the faces.]</p>
<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t know, hand orientation is developed in foetuses&#8217;, and is largely determined by observing which hand is predominately held closest to the mouth.  So, if you are a lefty, you&#8217;re in a select club, as I believe just 10% of the world&#8217;s population use their left hand more than their right.</p>
<p>Now you would think that you could leave the subject there wouldn&#8217;t you?  But oh no, somewhere along the line a bunch of pillocks made it their sole duty to spread a heap of malicious gossip, rumours and groundless facts about the left-handed community &#8211; largely, I suspect, because they had little else to do and television hadn&#8217;t been invented.</p>
<p>So why have the left-handed people of the world been persecuted down the centuries?  Two old faithful subjects I&#8217;m afraid, the uneducated and the help of a certain amount of religious faiths.  How the hell can religion creep its way into the left and right-handed debate is beyond me.  Still, where there&#8217;s a will there&#8217;s a way I suppose.</p>
<p>I guess you just make stuff up to suit your own ends, slap it in a book, then tell everyone you meet that it&#8217;s the gospel truth!  It seems back then, if you could get past the inane folk law and superstitions, some of which are still believed to this day, you might be lucky enough to have avoided being burned to death at the stake as a witch. </p>
<p>Did you know that in some countries if a child is seen using their left hand, it&#8217;s tied behind their back, at home and at school!  And certain religious faiths believe that if you eat with your left hand, you are feeding the devil with your right.  What have you got to be taking to make this shit up? </p>
<p>So it seems as far back as year dot, we &#8216;the strange ones&#8217; have been suppressed.  Historically, the left side, and of course left-handedness, was considered negative in many cultures &#8211; brilliant!  And if that wasn&#8217;t bad enough, some how from the Latin word, <em>sinistra,</em>which originally meant &#8216;left&#8217;, some bastard managed to turn it around to mean &#8216;evil&#8217; or &#8216;unlucky&#8217;!!!  Fer fuck&#8217;s sake &#8211; how the hell did that come about?  Too many recreational drugs my nan reckons.</p>
<p>And it didn&#8217;t stop there either.  While everyone who could, were making up shit as they went along, somebody managed to convert the word, <em>&#8216;sinistra&#8217;</em> to the English word, sinister!  Well thanks for that ya wanker!</p>
<p>However, evidence shows that lefties been around for a long time and aren&#8217;t about to disappear any time soon.  If you were an Inca, you would have been known as a top dog, the main man, because the indigenous people of the Andes considered that left-hander&#8217;s possess special abilities, including magic and healing powers.  And get this, in Tantric Buddhism the left represents wisdom!  Yeah baby, so take it out of that you right handed buff-oo00ns!</p>
<p>And let&#8217;s not forget that well known Russian literary offering written by Nikola Leskov in 1881.  He had a character in his story called, <em>&#8216;levsha&#8217; </em>which means, lefty or left hander.  Thanks to the success of his work, the word <em>&#8216;levsha&#8217; </em>became a common noun for skilled craftsman after his book was published.  The book title?  Surely you&#8217;ve heard of it?  Oh well, here it is for your reference, it&#8217;s called &#8216;The Tale of Cross-eyed Lefty and the Steel Flea&#8217;.  Trust me, it does exist, and what a great read and friend it must be when you and your family book a holiday to the Butlins branch of Siberia!!!</p>
<p>Left, well I&#8217;m off, I&#8217;m looking to buy a left-handed ashtray and some left-handed darts&#8230;</p>

<p>Now chaps, you know what some wives are like, they&#8217;ll get a bee in their bonnet about something and won&#8217;t let it lie until the &#8216;itch&#8217; has been well and truly scratched&#8230;</p>
<p>I know, I was married to two such women, on separate occasions I should add, but both of the ladies concerned seemed to buy items with their eyes instead of their brains!  Now we know that the thong-wearers are wired differently to the boxer shorts brigade, but really, at what stage in their lives does the fairer sex lose their common sense cell?</p>
<p>If it makes them go, &#8220;Aaah,&#8221; they&#8217;ll but it, and when you&#8217;re married there can be an awful lot of &#8220;Aaah&#8221; moments during the course of one week.  Case in point &#8211; my first little hooded cobra used to ride horses and belonged to a local stable.  Now I didn&#8217;t have a problem with that until I discovered that we had more straw in our car than the stable had!  And there&#8217;s nothing quite like taking a drive only to find that the interior smells like a dung heap!</p>
<p>So, to the &#8220;Aaah&#8221; momemt in question &#8211; I came home from work to find we had two extra menbers of the family, one black and the other a ginger tom.  A cat at the stables had had a litter and there were seven kittens each looking for a new home.  My wife&#8217;s first line of defence was, &#8220;They didn&#8217;t cost anything.&#8221;  &#8220;Great,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;What about the bloody smell?&#8221;  Fluffy and cuddly they may have been, but being born in a rat-infested stables most definitely had its down side.</p>
<p>Everything I said after that was taken as a direct insult to my wife&#8217;s judgement.  You can&#8217;t win, so this is where us chaps start to learn the benefits of playing the &#8216;long game&#8217;, because saying, &#8220;See, I told you so &#8211; out loud,&#8221; will only go on to cause more grief in the long-run.  I waited and waited before making my final pitch.  &#8220;What about the fleas,&#8221;  I said, &#8220;they must be coated in them?&#8221;  Thinking she had the upper hand and an answer to everything, my ex replied, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll buy some flea collars tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, while purchasing a brace of flea collars seemed like the best way forward at the time, I can assure you that it wasn&#8217;t.  On the box it said, this collar will kill every single flea on your infested cat.  Take it from me &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t!  It might stun them initially or give them a nasty migraine, but on the whole, these fleas must have seen what was coming and said to each other, &#8220;Sod this for a game of soldiers, I&#8217;m off.&#8221;  And as soon as collar one was in place, around 100 blood-sucking critters disembarked on mass.  And you won&#8217;t be surprised to hear that much the same thing happened when collar two was applied.</p>
<p>Once they regrouped on our tabletop they soon realised that there wasn&#8217;t a whole heap of cover.  So, platoon by platoon, they leapt for their lives and then buried themselves in our front room carpet.  Now it&#8217;s it&#8217;s a funny thing, once they&#8217;d made themselves at home you become desensitised to the fact that you have a potential problem on your hands.  There was no scratching or itching, and after a week the word &#8216;flea&#8217;, didn&#8217;t enter our minds.  And right there is the weak link in the whole situation that&#8217;s about to befall you.</p>
<p>Even your first &#8216;itch and scratch&#8217; moment doesn&#8217;t jog your memory, because it only happens once.  Unbeknown to yourself, your partner has had an &#8216;itch and scratch&#8217; moment all of her own, but doesn&#8217;t mention it because again, it only occurred once.  A few days later you&#8217;re sitting in the same room and you&#8217;re both intermittently scratching different parts of your bodies, but you still haven&#8217;t twigged that you&#8217;re doing it simultaneously now!</p>
<p>Then, quite by chance, you&#8217;re flicking through the channels on the TV, and during a pause in consentration you find yourself listening to part of a documentary that&#8217;s just about to reel off the facts surrounding the lifecycle of the flea.  And it&#8217;s only then that the copper coinage to the value of a hundreth of a pound falls from the sky, and lands on auntie Muriel&#8217;s favourite glass figurine of a dolphin, knocking its tail off! </p>
<p>Then, when you learn that all you need is one female to start a massive infestation, because she can knock out up to 50 eggs a day, you start to sit up and take stock of the problem that&#8217;s lying in wait.  Do you call the flea man?  No!  Why?  Because your wife, who brought the problem into the flat, the problem that was <strong>free</strong>, couldn&#8217;t bare the shame of a van pulling up outside the flat with the words &#8216;Pest Control&#8217; emblazoned on it, just in case the neighbours see it draw up.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s a lull in the itching and a marked cessation in the scratching department, and all talk of hopping blood suckers drops right off the agenda &#8211; but only until I went out for a few beers, came home and slept in my socks.  The very next day at work I couldn&#8217;t understand why I was scratching so much however, it didn&#8217;t take long to backtrack the story. </p>
<p>If one lady flea can produce about 50 eggs a day, that roughly 350 a week.  Add another eight or nine days to that, and you can see how quickly you could open your own flea farm.  Well lucky old us!  We started with about 200 of the little buggers, and if only 25% on them were &#8216;bra wearers&#8217; it wouldn&#8217;t take long for them to overrun our flat.</p>
<p>Add the fact that they can sense footsteps and jump, by ratio, a 1000 time further than humans, and it&#8217;s not surprising that they made it up the non-carpeted stairs to our bedroom!  Then muggings comes home a few sheets to the wind and hits the pit, still wearing his socks.  Wallop!  It&#8217;s morning and I&#8217;m late, I grab the first set of clothes I can find and head off to work.  After a phone call to my wife, these poignant factors were enough to push her ever closer to the Yellow Pages and a section marked &#8216;Ankle biter obliterators&#8217; </p>
<p>The call goes through, and a few hours later your savior arrives with a spray gun in a luminous pink van with the words  &#8216;INFESTATION KILLERS&#8217; slapped on both sides of the vehicle in Day-Glo green!  But hey, by then you&#8217;d quite happily swap your wife for a canister of insecticide and forty quid and watch as she and the flea man disappeared into the sunset!  My advice to you&#8230; never under estimate the power of even the smallest of females!!!</p>
