				<small>April 18th, 2011 <!-- by Neil --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Well&#8230;if Nora Clacket from Dunbar had checked in to the Silver Hills psychiatric hospital, would anybody have given a toss?  No, is the simple answer to that.  However, if you&#8217;re a newly outed celebrity mental, outed by your publicist that is, man you&#8217;re gonna be popular!  I would&#8217;ve loved to have been a fly on the wall during that meeting&#8230;</p>
<p>As a type II sufferer, I am a tad confused by the statement issued by Catherine Zeta Jones&#8217;s spokeswoman, Cece Yorke.  She confirmed that she had received mental health treatment to help her cope with her traumatic personal life. &#8216;After dealing with the stress of the past year, Catherine made the decision to check into a mental health facility for a brief stay to treat her bipolar II disorder,&#8217; she said.  She&#8217;s feeling great and looking forward to starting work this week on two upcoming films.&#8217; </p>
<p>Now, up until that point in the media, no-one knew that Zeta-Jones had a bipolar disorder, and hey, why should they, it&#8217;s none of their business.  So why disclose the news now, giving the just merest amount of facts, and then nothing more since the initial statement?  [Methinks someone was about to dish the dirt, and this was a PR excercise to quell the naughty rumours, while appeasing the film company&#8217;s backers that a certain party won&#8217;t be taken away in a &#8216;happy limo&#8217;, in the new Gucci &#8216;all-in-one jacket&#8217; (straps a permanent feature) during takes!  Well &#8211; films are awfully expensive to make now-a-days.]   </p>
<p>Obviously, I don&#8217;t have a problem with people who suffer with a mental illness, but what I&#8217;m pissed off about, and believe me I am fuming, is the way this annoucement has been handled by her publicist.  This is how it came across to me sane, sober, and as &#8216;well&#8217; as I can be for the last nine years, after five break-downs. </p>
<p>Everything in Catherine Zeta Jones&#8217;s life was all going swimmingly: films, wealth, married into the Douglas family (more chashy-wonga) more films,(even more green-backs) had a couple kids, blah, blah, blah and blah.  And then &#8211; WALLOP &#8211; out of nowhere &#8211; she&#8217;s a mental  &#8211; and five days later she&#8217;s &#8216;feeling great&#8217;!  </p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to know what form of treatment she had, I could&#8217;ve done with that a few years ago.  &#8220;Mr Walton, you have a type II bipolar disorder.  Take four years out of your life while we find a drug that will give you a therapeutic effect.&#8221;  [Doffs cap &#8211; drags carcass out of hospital &#8211; loses job, house and marriage.]   I can only assume that Ms Jones must have slept in a new mental health microwave.  &#8220;Six minutes on high nurse,  Ms Jones your treatment is complete.&#8221;  &#8220;There&#8217;s lovely aren&#8217;t I, heres $3,850, oh bollocks, make it four grand.&#8221;     </p>
<p>From a medical prospective and my personal experiences of the disorder, I can&#8217;t help think that Ms Jones&#8217;s publicist has dropped a bollock on this one, because the story doesn&#8217;t add up.  I listened, completely agog, at information that all she had suffered with was 12 months of stress due to her husband&#8217;s diagnosis of throat cancer, she&#8217;d hit the drink and her fag input had reached the chain-smoking level.  Clearly there&#8217;s more to the story, there has to be. </p>
<p>Will we find out the truth?  Oh yeah, you just wait, it&#8217;ll be a disgruntled former maid, chef or pool girl who blows it wide open, and all because a caring sharing publicist was worried that the stigma of mental ill health would affect her clients earning power and reduce her own income.  </p>
<p>I sincerely wish you well Catherine, and don&#8217;t worry, you are in a great circle of decent human beings, and if you ever want a chat, feel free to contact me (yeah, like that&#8217;s going to happen) but please, get a new publicist.  She has personally insulted me, and the rest of the bipolar squad, by her lack of knowledge of the illness, and given the impression that you can treat a type II bipolar disorder in five days&#8230;</p>
<p>Ooh look &#8211; it&#8217;s the Lithium lady!!!</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve seen them before &#8211; car-crash documentaries involving complete arses who fully believe they can commune with wild animals.  Not the itty-bitty small wild animals no, the bloody great flesh eating variety or the ones that are so poisonous, that if they fart in a neighbour&#8217;s kitchen, you&#8217;ll die as well.</p>
<p>It is without doubt the most excruciating form of viewing I find.  And I&#8217;ve lost count of the times that I&#8217;ve sat in my chair wincing and listened to these self-taught pillocks say, &#8220;Look how angry it&#8217;s getting,&#8221; hoping upon hope that the cocksure twat gets bitten right in the arse!  Jesus!  Of course its getting angry you prat, you&#8217;ve woken it up, you&#8217;re poking it with a stick, and in a minute you&#8217;re going to swing it round by its tail!!! </p>
<p>How many more times have we got to watch grown men striding about in khaki shorts, thinking they&#8217;re Doctor-bloody-Dolittle, and basically showing off their talents on camera?  Oh they get away with their antics for years and years, writing books and even opening their own sanctuaries.  But does it stop there &#8211; does it bollocks! </p>
<p>Then they get a little too &#8216;up&#8217; themselves, and go on to boast about their understanding of these exotic killer beasts, while raking in a bunch of cash for their retirement fund.  [Case in point: please see post &#8216;You&#8217;ll have to bear with me on this&#8217;. (2009/08/09) </p>
<p>There was once, and I can&#8217;t emphasise the word &#8216;once&#8217; enough, who thought he comprehended the workings and ways of the American bear, he wrote about them, filmed them and eventually camped out in their surroundings.  He did it for years and gained much notoriety and some fame for his efforts.  The notoriety pumped up his already inflated ego and the fame made him believe he was God-sent to be at one with the bears.  What happened?  Yip, they ate him!  So with this in mind, here&#8217;s another story of brazen stupidity, and believe me, you couldn&#8217;t make this up&#8230;</p>
<p>Born the son of a roughty-toughty mechanic, Ron wanted to be a ballet dancer, and right there is where it all started to go wrong for Ron.  His dad was hoping that his son would take over the family business one day.  But no, instead of warming to the look of a grease monkey, he picked up a vat of grease paint, and headed off to France.  Once there, he joined the Follies Bergere, where he starred as a nude dancer &#8211; ewwwwwwwwwww gross!</p>
<p>When he hit 30 Ron knew that he had to hang up his tights, as lifting up twiglet-sized females all day can play havoc with your knees.  It was a sad day, but you know what performers are like, they just can&#8217;t bloody stop doing it can they.  Give &#8217;em a crowd of no more than a couple pensioners and a goat and they&#8217;re off.  All tits and teeth &#8211; it&#8217;s enough to make you puke.</p>
<p>After months of not knowing what to do with himself, he hooked up with a childhood sweetheart Joy, and between them they decided it would be a great idea to train up big some cats and perform with them, while avoiding a proper job altogether.  This would prove to be his, well another friend, and Joys downfall anyway.</p>
<p>Well, they took the show on the road, with some success, but as time went on, they got more cats and needed another pair of hands.  Enter a lithe and young Chuck.  &#8220;Oooh, he was gorgeous,&#8221; said a very bi Ron, as bi as a fox with in a tu-tu in fact, but never the less they went on to become a famous threesome, in every sense of the meaning.  In came the cash, up went their status, and they went onto open an animal sanctuary.  Yes folks, we&#8217;ve reached &#8216;that&#8217; part of the tale.</p>
<p>[Before I go any further, I thought I should explain this crucial fact.  Having an in-bred or a cross-bred cat causes major problems in the long run, largely in the eating department.  If a lion mates with a tiger, for example, you end up with a beautiful, but confused offspring.  Half of it wants to go for a swim, and the other half doesn&#8217;t.  The result &#8211; one pissed off person-eater.]</p>
<p>As with most shows, they needed to be updated to keep the audiences interest, and when the bookings dropped off, our chum Ron, in his buttock-hugging leather shorts said, &#8220;We just gotta get a white tiger.&#8221;  Enter Jupiter. </p>
<p>Now, he was a gorgeous beast and no mistake, 600lbs of teeth and claws, but graceful with it.  Chuck raised him and all was well initially.  However, the fact of the matter is this, most white tigers are in-bred, and overall, this leaves you with a very large and unpredictable animal.  Did Ronnie-baby know this fact?  Well, yes he did.  Did he care?  I don&#8217;t think so.  All he wanted was the stardom and the fame to continue, no matter what.  Big mistake!  Chuck tripped over some equipment that was left lying about one day, because they were having a new new cage built.  This startled Jupiter, and he jumped all over his trainer, leaving him permanently short of breath.  <strong>Shock-horror-gasp</strong>!  Man-eating animal eats man!!!</p>
<p>At this point Joy stopped eating, became depressed and then suicidal, and in Ron&#8217;s own words, &#8220;She was praying to die, she didn&#8217;t know how she was going to die, she just wanted to.&#8221;  Well poor old Ron, two rutting partners down &#8211; one &#8216;brown bread&#8217; (slang: dead) and one who was suffering from acute melancholia, (the fear of cute melons).</p>
<p>In a bid to rally the spirits of his ailing partner, he woke her up one night and asked her if she&#8217;d like to go and see the &#8216;babies&#8217;.  Eventually, she prised herself up from her mattress, went to the fridge, picked up a few meaty tit-bits and followed Ron towards the cat enclosure.</p>
<p>She handed a few piece of one dead animal to a larger living one and received a hug for her efforts, and then Burt the tiger was led back into its pen.  Overjoyed with the outcome , soppy bollocks brought back Jupiter, with the hope of the same success.  Well, you know what life&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s got that nasty habit of biting you right in the arse when you&#8217;re least expecting it.  And unfortunately, Jupiter was a tad hungrier than everyone one thought, favouring a good sized chunk out of Joy&#8217;s neck, rather than a handful prime rump. </p>
<p>What did the surviving member of The Cat Dancers say to the huge in-bred beast, &#8220;What have you done to mom?&#8221;  As he couldn&#8217;t speak yet, Jupiter began crying and sniveling, according to Ronald.  No he wasn&#8217;t you prat, he was licking his lips and hoping for a plateful of dessert!</p>
<p>So, what have learned from this ridiculous circle-world farce?  Never, under any circumstances, let a bi-sexual ballet dancer teach a classroom full of students about animal husbandry, never ever think that for one moment that you are a tigers parent, and if you do lose two dear shagging partners to one man-eating animal, at least you&#8217;ll get a nice big rug out of the deal if it all does go fun-bags upper most&#8230;</p>
<p>Right, I&#8217;m off to adopt a crocodile&#8230;cab&#8230;</p>

				<small>April 4th, 2011 <!-- by Neil --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p> </p>
<p>True story</p>
<p>You know what it&#8217;s like, you&#8217;re young, the sun&#8217;s out and you head towards your local to see who else has come out to play&#8230;</p>
<p>Well, by midday Saturday, around 30 of the usual crew had arrived at our second home, and everyone was full of expectations of another daft afternoon.  After the general ribbing was out of the way, and the first pint had been sunk, the inane group-chats would ensue.   I was sitting outside at the front of the pub, at a table, with a dozen other friends around me. </p>
<p>Just beyond our table was the car park, and it was customary for one of us to open the boot of their car and turn on the radio so we could listen to the Kenny Everett show, on Capital Radio.  (If you&#8217;ve never heard of Kenny Everett, look him up on the net, he had a great sense of the absurd, and was the first DJ to give Bohemian Rhapsody, by Queen, airtime.) </p>
<p>Anyway, during a lull in the banter, two of the crowd stood up with out a word spoken, and walked towards the the roadside.  After a few minutes the rest of us began to wonder what they were up to, and fired a salvo of drunken comments to  that effect, but they didn&#8217;t reply. </p>
<p>Eventually they crossed the road, pints still in hand, and then made tracks towards the edge of Epping Forest, which was literally opposite the pub.  I wasn&#8217;t sure if what happened next was caused by the heat of the day or copious amounts of lager or a combination of both, but for some reason they both disappeared into the undergrowth giggling like a couple of school kids.</p>
<p>From our prime position we could hear a whole bunch of high-pitched girly squealing emanating from the forest&#8217;s edge, and the overall group thought was, &#8220;What the fuck are they up too?&#8221;  We still didn&#8217;t have a visual on them at this stage, but what we could see bore all the hallmarks of a Benny Hill sketch. </p>
<p>Branches began to move independently, even though there wasn&#8217;t a hint of a breeze.  Twigs and leaves began to fall to the ground, and all of this was interspersed with hysterical laughter, which eventually spread to our table.  Suddenly, two heads appeared above the branches looking indifferent directions, one of them shouted, &#8220;GO&#8221;, and they both jumped out from behind the tree and made their way back to us stark bollock naked, pints still in hand!  Why?  Only they knew that. </p>
<p>Fits of raucous laughter broke out immediately as they stopped by the roadside and casually lent against the street sign chatting to one another.  All verbal contact was impossible as they were to far away from us, but from sip to swig they raised their glasses at us and smiled as they took in the view, as did a cluster of cyclist when they shot past them!</p>
<p>As their pints were running low they decide to give us a final performancebefore disappearing back into the foilage to retrieve their cloths, so to finish what they had started, they began flashing their down-belows at as many motorists as possible. </p>
<p>There was much waving and stretching of wedding tackle, followed by the pressing of warm goolies on the drivers and passengers side windows as the traffic slowed down and stopped.  Well it had to stop, as one or both of them were blocking the road!  It was an unbelievable sight and, again, tears of laughter were shed, and what I found the most surprising was &#8211; no one reported the incident to the police!</p>
