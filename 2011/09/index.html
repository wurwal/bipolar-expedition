<p>If you’re old enough to remember Twiggy, you’ll recall she was no wider that a coat hanger, and since the 60’s of swing, model-wise at least, nothing has really change except the bizarre efforts of the fashion designers…</p>
<p>Well no, two things have altered over the years as it goes, there’s now a ‘lard arse’ range to appease the bloaters of society who can’t stop forcing Mc Donald’s down their necks, and the re-touching guys still have a license to shave pounds of off a model by doctoring the pictures.  And the next thing you know an eight year old girl says to her mum, “I need to go on a diet if I’m going to look like Kate Moss,” and a browbeaten mother replies, “I’ll get some cigarettes, strong coffee and a bag of coke for you tomorrow dear!”</p>
<p>I’m not sure who’s the worst, the designers or the celebrities that buy their clothes, then fawn all over them for producing a master piece for them.  Alex McQueen was a prime example; local boy makes good, but even he ended up brown bread (dead).  There’s no doubt that his earlier pieces were the work of a craftsman, well he did learn his trade in Savile Row after all, and in short he was the dogs wotsits at a very young age.  But it all seems to go breasts upper most when fame and fortune catches up with these people. </p>
<p>Have you seen what comes down the catwalk lately?  More importantly, have you seen the piece worn anywhere else?  I mean, if you want to wear something that looks like green marzipan with a chandelier dumped on your bonce, you help yourself.  It’ll probably only set you back 12,000 grand and rest assured, no one down the supermarket will be wearing the same mess.  In fact I doubt whether you’ll find an occasion to wear the bloody thing in the first place.</p>
<p>So, as a hot-shot designer with a bundle in the bank, you can really let loose with your creative side, knowing full well that some twit with more money than sense will buy what ever you make for them.  Would you buy a neck scarf for 300 big ones?  Well that’s what happens when you have your own brand name, you can charge what you like!  However, when this occurs you find yourself at parties three times a week and a whole bunch of new ‘friends’ whose main intent is to supply you with as much Colombianmarching powder as you can stick up your schnoz.</p>
<p>Well, how odd, the McQueen range suddenly went into overdrive, and his work became more and more farcical.  I’m still trying to discover who thought it would be a great idea to purchase a dress that looked as if it had been fashioned out of carpet off-cuts &#8211; in purple!  I mean, you can actually see the cocaine at work.  Oh yeah, I can stay up for three days straight and design a dress, the trouble is I’m pretty sure no one would look twice at my matching Swiss roll meets brown  Plasticine ensemble or would they?     </p>
<p>Other pieces of McQueen’s work have been described as thus: from the autumn range, “A dress with a floral embellishment.”  I kid you not; it was a bush, with leaves and twigs included!  Next; “A white coral reef skirt.”  Yip, if it wasn&#8217;t a recently under cooked omelette, then I&#8217;ve got two bottoms!  And what was he on when he thought that designing a pink boiler suit with a snood and a gas mask was a good idea!  Moreover, who agreed with him when he slapped the first sketch down on the table?</p>
<p>Honestly, these people get so far up themselves they can’t see the dress for the trees!  And what about the models?  Well, they’re young and will probably wear anything for the right money, but all the same, what a life.  All are hoping to be the next top catwalk queen, but in the run up to that coke-fuelled position, they’re pushed and pulled about, makeup is slapped all over their heads and they have to subscribe to a diet of a lettuce leaf and 400 cigarettes a week.  So it’s no surprise when they lose the will to smile.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter what I say because the clothes cattle market will carry on long after I’m in my box.  And if your wife or partner wants to dress up in a matching two-piece ‘Borrowers’ outfit, let her get on with it.  In fact, get yourself one; it’ll give the members of the Rotary Club something to talk about. </p>
<p>Rest assured, you’ll know if you&#8217;ve been to a high class catwalk show, all you have to do is check the maximum load sign in the lift.  Instead of stating it can carry 1000lbs or eight people &#8211; it’ll say 1000lbs or 36 models!</p>

				<h2><a href="../../call-that-a-side-effect/index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Call that a side-effect!">Call that a side-effect!</a></h2>
				<small>September 11th, 2011 <!-- by Neil --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p> </p>
<p>This is the follow-on from, &#8216;You know when you just want a beer&#8217;.  Adapted from chapter three of Bi Polar Expedition. </p>
<p>If you’re unfortunate enough to join the world of the mental health system, you’ll learn one fact pretty much straight away, understanding your disorder and the medication you’re prescribed is an ongoing learning curve from the outset…</p>
<p>All I knew at the time was I was ill and hospital, and the drugs administered would, in time, help me recover apparently.  However, not once, at the beginning of my bipolarity did anyone mention the word, side-effects or add the prefix &#8211; severe!  Just so you know, all forms of medication have a side-effect of some kind, even aspirin.  Most go unnoticed but, as I found out to my cost, the stronger the drug, the more powerful the side-effects can be.</p>
<p>So I’d escaped with the ward keys and hit the local pub and, as I’d been a naughty boy, (out witted the staff) I was jumped on, sedated and then pasted out.  I woke up to discover a burning sensation on my forehead, and a loud and repetitive banging noise in the background. </p>
<p>All of a sudden the door of my room burst open and in stormed the cleaner from hell.  It was ages before I was able to work out why my ears were more sensitive than normal, but it was all down to my first batch of injected anti-psychotic drugs.  After what seemed like an hour all went quiet, and my door was closed again. </p>
<p>For the next three days I sat in a vegetative state with an inane grin on my face and by day four I was in a bad way.  You could’ve slap with six pound turbot and I would’ve just sat there and smiled at you!  I could only manage to walk in short pigeon-steps and my legs were locked at the knees in a half-bent position. </p>
<p>It was a bizarre situation and try as I might, I couldn&#8217;t stand up straight.  Brilliant!  Not only did I feel like prat, the predicament had left me eight inches shorter! </p>
<p>Then I noticed my forearms, they were stuck out in front me like a puppeteer, which would’ve been okay, but I didn&#8217;t have any puppets.  Thinking it couldn’t get any worse, it did.  I found that my fingers and thumbs were all pointing towards the floor, and like my knees, were also frozen.  And to top it all off, every time I went to sit down, literally two seconds later I had an uncontrollable compulsion to stand up.   </p>
<p>Day by day something else joined the list of ever-growing side-effects.  I can laugh about it now, but I was in a great deal of pain, pain like you would never believe.  I tried to console myself that it couldn&#8217;t be as painful as child birth, but it didn&#8217;t help.  Fortunately, only person saw me in this state. and ever helpful my good friend evaluated my situation for the record.  He said I looked like ET with a beard.  What are mates for!  A week later I was still in the same condition.</p>
<p>As time progressed the agony spread its way from my legs, arms and hands and settled nicely in the whole length of my spine.  A full night’s sleep was impossible, I couldn’t sleep on my back or my front, and in the end I slept on alternate sides, waking up, on the hour, every hour.  I started to think that the Irish River Dance troupe had been practising on it for a month. </p>
<p>Eventually, after three weeks of agony and broken sleep, I started getting some answers to my crippling situation.  After speaking to the meds man on the ward it became apparent that I’d had a severe adverse reaction to my recent jab and it was called, akathisia.  Yip, never heard of it either, but by God I new I had it!   </p>
<p>Okay, how long was this debilitating side-effect going to last for, I asked?  Well, certainly no longer than 14 weeks!!!  I was given an extra tablet to take with my usual medication to help the crippling effects of the akathisia, but what I hadn’t anticipated was that the so-called anti side-effect tablet had a side-effect all of its own.  Three days later I found out what it was &#8211; constipation!   </p>
<p>A week later, I was still having problems sleeping and was given another tablet to take.  Guess what, I now had a new side-effect to cope with, blurred vision, mostly with a tad of extra lethargy.  If I wasn’t walking the corridors or circumnavigating the hospital grounds, in small circles I might add, I could be found propping up a wall in the corner of the day room.  You couldn’t miss me.  I was the blind, bearded, stationary alien with a packet of Ex-lax sticking out of his top pocket!  If there is a God, I just like to say, yeah thanks for that…</p>

<p>A true story</p>
<p>So I escaped.  Well, it wasn’t my fault someone left a dirty great bunch of keys in the soap well of the sink in the ward office.  I spotted them and  Wallop mate &#8211; I was off and  headed straight for the locked ward door&#8230;</p>
<p>Once outside and past the reception, I threw the keys into a mass of bushes and proceeded to stroll down the half-mile road which led to the main gates of the ‘Fun factory’.  On reaching the entrance I had a quick shufti to find that, so far, I hadn’t been followed and when I looked over the road there was a site to behold &#8211; a pub.</p>
<p>Ambling into the car park I noticed a black London cab and the drivers’ door slightly ajar.  The temptation to climb in and mess about with the instrumentation on the dash board was far stronger than my medication. </p>
<p>After much pushing, touching and fiddling I got out and made my way to the pub door.  I may have been mental and heavily medicated, but I still had a few ‘normal’ marbles left in reserve.  So, to satisfy my worst fear, I touched the pub’s brickwork just to check it wasn’t a mirage, nope it was rock solid.</p>
<p>It must have been near closing time, as I could see the staff clearing up.  Undeterred, I entered my oasis and ordered a pint of Guinness.  As the barman placed it on the bar I said, “Can I owe you for that, only I haven’t got any money on me at the moment.”  By the look on the bar steward’s face I could see he wasn’t too pleased with my request. </p>
<p>As quickly as he poured it, the accommodating sod chucked the pint down the sink.  Six weeks without a beer had made tetchy, so, gutted by his unfriendly nature, I left the bar and decided to stir things up in the car park.</p>
<p>I spied a brand new 4&#215;4 Land Rover and thought I would test out its suspension.  For a short time I jumped up and down on the running board on the drivers’ side.  After a while this felt a bit tame, so I climbed onto the roof via a small ladder on the back of the vehicle and had a proper bounce about.  Oh yes, this was much more aesthetically pleasing.  At this point of the proceedings, a gin sodden old bint stuck her head out of an upstairs window. </p>
<p>Her opening gambit was most unbecoming of a lady, and in true fishwife style she hurled a volley of abuse at me.  I must have answered her back, but for the life of me I can’t remember what I said, more&#8217;s the pity.  I presumed that this ravishing, Gordon’s gin blue-eyed beauty queen, 1947-1987, was the landlord’s wife, poor bugger.</p>
<p>Jesus it was a state.  She had a face like a clear plastic bag full of crushed walnuts which had been ravaged by time and alcohol.  I was soon joined in the car park by the publican and his young son, to the shriek of, “Look Bert, he’s climbing all over our new Motor”, spoken in a heavy cockney accent.  I thought he was going to ask me in for a night-cap. </p>
<p>But no, instead he was offering to rip off both of my arms and beat me to death with them.  Some people just can’t take a joke!  Somebody must have phoned the hospital because a Ford Transit van pulled up and out stepped four familiar faces from N2’s night-staff.</p>
<p>I was ‘helped’ into the van and returned to the ward.  I tried to do a runner from the main corridor but the nurses were all over me like a rash, and a bit later I was asked the whereabouts of the ward keys.  I told them roughly where I&#8217;d aimed them, but the trouble was there were literally thousands of bushes in the grounds of the hospital.  I said they had more chance of setting up a threesome with a couple of novice nuns than retrieving the lost keys, but they would insist we searched for them.</p>
<p>So off we trotted into the night with a couple of torches and hope in our hearts!  After 20 minutes of fruitless scavenging through the undergrowth the search was abandoned.  I was frog-marched back to a single bed side-room on my ward, restrained and injected.  [Part II to follow]  </p>
