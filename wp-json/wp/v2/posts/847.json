slip"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>He\u2019s got a face you could quite happily slap with a box jellyfish and somehow, from a rock pool in Barking, he\u2019s crawled his way out and is now a member of the European Parliament.\u00a0 Nick \u2018Would you let me kiss your baby\u2019 Griffin made a complete arse of himself recently on Question Time and now the BNP have been investigated by the Panorama team in a programme aired the BBC called, The Fraud Exposed.\u00a0 The words \u2018smoke\u2019 and \u2018fire\u2019 come to mind\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Now we all know political parties have their secret funders, and you can\u2019t help but wonder why you would want to remain anonymous?\u00a0 Some might say it\u2019s because of their integrity and others may say it\u2019s purely down to personal choice, but I\u2019m not sure this is the case when you pledged your allegiance to the British Nasty Party.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>If I didn&#8217;t know better I\u2019d say they were spineless coward\u2019s ladies and gentlemen, cowards with something to hide.\u00a0 Although\u00a0\u00a0 from the outside looking in, it seems as if these private funders are embarrassed to be openly associated with this party because of their views on the far right and want to protect their careers.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I mean, just at a basic level, would you vote for a person who surrounds himself with \u2018knuckle grazers\u2019 who only learned to walk upright that week.\u00a0 Have you seen them?\u00a0 They all look as if they should be working on the door at an east end night club!\u00a0 Call me Mr Picky, but wouldn&#8217;t it give off a better air if heir Griffin used professional security guards!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Over the years its clarity and access to information that makes a party popular , that\u2019s why most political parties have a registered HQ which is accessible to the public, and its run by a thoroughly nice chap or \u2018chapess\u2019 and an administrator.\u00a0 Why, there would even be a sign on the outside of the building that would welcome you in for a chat.\u00a0 Not so for the, so called, British Neurosis Party\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Imagine the meeting somewhere in Barking, east London.\u00a0 \u201cWhere can we set up our HQ so all of our members can drop by and tarry awhile over our policies?\u00a0 Ooh, I know, how about a low industrial estate in east Belfast!\u00a0 And who should we approach to set up this base of warm accessibility?\u00a0 How about that friendly former Ulster Loyalist and fund raiser Jim Dowson?\u00a0 Perfect!\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The BNP were resident at this unit for two and a half years, there were CCTV cameras everywhere, but what they didn\u2019t have was a sign outside stating who they were.\u00a0 Very odd don\u2019t you think?\u00a0 Surely, if they were that popular they would advertise their party and proclaim their open door policy to their proud members one and all?\u00a0 Conning the thick and the easily led if you ask me!<\/p>\n<p>As the big bucks began rolling in Mr Griffin had elevated his status to an MEP.\u00a0 Now would be the perfect time to acquire a decent residence for their party\u2019s headquarters. \u00a0Did they aspire to this obvious plan &#8211; did they bollocks!\u00a0 They did \u00a0\u00a0move their operation to Cumbria though, but sadly that\u2019s were the clarity and openness ends, and they left a trail of debt behind them.\u00a0 In terms of being honest it seems; it doesn&#8217;t appear to be the BNP\u2019s most redeeming feature.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>They choose another low key industrial estate for their European Office, unit 3B to be precise, and again they forgot that all important sign outside.\u00a0 Sound odd to you &#8211; I\u2019d say it sounds a tad shady.\u00a0 But there\u2019s more\u2026\u00a0 Then they moved their National Office into unit 3A next door, where at some point it\u2019s claimed, the electric was siphoned from their Euro office.\u00a0 Can you smell smoke?<\/p>\n<p>All claims of the financial irregularities have been denied and this leaves the leader of the British Nazi Party with an unblemished record, for now.\u00a0 You could he\u2019s whiter than white, I won\u2019t but you could.\u00a0 So, the date of this text is 00\/00\/00 let\u2019s see how long it takes the police to catch up with Mr Griffin and his east end tactics, it can\u2019t be long now surely, I\u2019ll give it another 12 months.<\/p>\n<p>On paper, the BNP was technically in solvent in 2009, and again this has been denied by their Fuhrer.\u00a0 He claims the current accusations have been brought about by former party members with an axe to grind.\u00a0 Well, if I\u2019d been held hostage in a van in a Tesco\u2019s car park, I think I\u2019d be pretty pissed off!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Another question you have to ask yourself is, who would you choose to be the party treasurer?\u00a0 Surely you\u2019d make enquiries with one of the many reputable finance organizations &#8211; but no, Mr Griffin chose to employ a former bouncer and lard specialist instead!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Is it any wonder then, after a 27 year run, the BNP are down to just 10 counsellors \u00a0and their membership figures are dropping by the day\u2026<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a
