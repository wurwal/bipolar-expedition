\u00a0The place of strikes in a crisis, the place where a single leaf can shut down the entire network of London\u2019s over ground train system &#8211;\u00a0the place where snow can fall at any given moment.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I can only assume the head honchos working with Sebastian Coe were forced to attend a course in bullshit before signing up!\u00a0 Just the logistics of London Transport\u2019s tube network has got to be their biggest nightmare, and don\u2019t start me on the cost of the Games.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Picture the scene: you\u2019re on the starting grid to catch your first tube train of the day towards your place of work at the \u2018Kipper Splitters Emporium\u2019.\u00a0 You&#8217;ve got a drink and a round of sandwiches, just in case the train breaks down, and your shin and shoulder pads are in place, as are your gum shield and knuckle dusters.\u00a0 You put your head down and make a break for the sliding doors, and for your efforts, you secured a place crushed against a window in the standing position.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>From there you\u2019re thrown around for twenty minutes towards your next connection and when you alight you bite, kick and punch in a bid to tear yourself away from the on-board commuters.\u00a0 But it\u2019s only when you reach Kings Cross station you realise that 350,000 extra\u00a0foreign visitors have turned up for the Games and they\u2019re going to be\u00a0here every day for the duration of\u00a0 the Olympics.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I don\u2019t like to spilt hairs (believe that and you\u2019ll believe anything), but it\u2019s come to my notice that the events that make up the Games don\u2019t have many links with the past.\u00a0 In fact, 28 of the 38 events weren&#8217;t even invented at the time of the original Olympics, and how the hell Beach Volleyball and BMX cycling slip in as sports, it&#8217;s absolutely\u00a0farcical!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>So, the rush hour will become the \u2018crush hour\u2019, and 80% of the athletes will be within 20 minutes of their events and 97% will be within 30 minutes of their events.\u00a0\u00a0Aah haha aahahahaahahaha\u00a0 hahaha &#8211; priceless!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Have the Olympic board undertaken a dry run on a Monday morning with the expected extra weight of human traffic &#8211; doubtful.\u00a0 And right there is what should become a new Olympic sport &#8211; just\u00a0getting the athletes from their hotels to the arena!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The rumour is that 93% of training venues will be within 30 minutes of the athlete\u2019s village and the aim is for 90% of venues to be served by three or more forms of public transport.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Well we&#8217;ve got that now, and you still can\u2019t get to work on time!!!\u00a0 The Olympic board came to me for an answer to this problem obviously, and after seconds of rigorous power meetings with myself I\u2019m glad to say I have the solution. \u00a0Everyone living in the London area and\u00a0within a 15 miles radius of the M25 will have their homes boarded up so they can\u2019t leave their properties.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The next transportation problem will of course be our aviation system, which team GB hope to turn to their advantage in the javelin and the pole vault events.\u00a0 The plan is to ensure the incoming athlete\u2019s equipment and luggage is diverted to Guatemala!\u00a0 The M25 will remain a car park for the length of the Olympics. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Okay, let\u2019s take a look at the cost of 17 days of running, jumping and slinging various objects about\u00a0in a field.\u00a0 The estimated bill for staging the Olympic and Paralympics was \u00a32.1bn.\u00a0 Forget all of the other figures you may have heard about, as no one can accurately forecast the\u00a0eventual cost.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>So, after years of construction and hype, we\u2019ll be lucky if this project breaks even.\u00a0\u00a0And you wonder why your gas and electric has doubled recently! Yep, it\u2019s what your supplier is using to pay for advanced orders of fuel to cover the extra usage during 17 days of watching a bunch stick insects run about\u00a0a\u00a0bit. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>However, there is a last ditched plan to recoup some of the groats lost in the coffers, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019ll be subscribing to it.\u00a0 In this country we have been constantly reminded we\u2019re a bunch of \u2018lard-arses\u2019, and eating our five-a-day is the way forward. \u00a0There\u2019s even rumours of a fat tax &#8211; well how about this, <strong>DON\u2019T<\/strong> <strong>PUT THE CRAP IN OUR FOOD TO BEGIN WITH! \u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So what\u2019s the plan to redeem some cash?\u00a0 Lord Coe will raise funds through broadcast revenues, licensing, tickets and local and global Olympics sponsors such as Coca-Cola and McDonald&#8217;s.<\/p>\n<p>McDonald&#8217;s!\u00a0 At the Olympic Game!\u00a0 Are you bloody sure?<\/p>\n<div
