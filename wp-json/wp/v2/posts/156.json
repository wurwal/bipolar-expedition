would be as\u00a0funny as it is.\u00a0 This\u00a0piece was sent to me by a friend and its an article that was in\u00a0Housekeeping\u00a0 Monthtly\u00a0 on the\u00a013th of May 1955.\u00a0 \u00a0Grid your loins girls it was written by a female and it&#8217;s called, The Good Wife&#8217;s Guide&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>1.\u00a0 Have dinner ready.\u00a0 Plan ahead, even the night before, to have a delicious meal ready on time for his return.\u00a0 This is a way of letting him know that you&#8217;ve been thinking of him<strong> <\/strong>and are concerned for his needs.\u00a0 Most men are hungry when they come home and the prospect of a good meal (especially his favourite) is part of the warm welcome needed.<\/p>\n<p>2.\u00a0 Prepare yourself.\u00a0 Take 15 minutes to rest so you&#8217;ll be refreshed when he arrives.\u00a0 Touch up your make-up, put a ribbon in your hair and be fresh looking.\u00a0 He has just been with a lot of work weary people.<\/p>\n<p>3.\u00a0 Be a little gay and more interesting for him.\u00a0 His boring day may need a lift and one of your<strong> <\/strong>duties is to provide it.\u00a0 Clear away clutter.\u00a0 Make one last trip through the main part of the house just before your husband arrives.\u00a0 Gather up schoolbooks, toys, paper etc and then run the dust-cloth over the table.<\/p>\n<p>4.\u00a0 Over the cooler months of the year you should prepare and light a fire.\u00a0 Your husband will feel hehas reached a haven of rest and order, and it will give him a lift too.\u00a0 After all catering for his comfort will provide you with immense personal satisfaction.<\/p>\n<p>5.\u00a0 Prepare the children.\u00a0 Take a few minutes to wash the children&#8217;s hands and faces (if they are small), comb their hair and if necessary, change their clothes.\u00a0 They are little treasures and he would like to see them playing their part.\u00a0 Minimise all noise.\u00a0 At the time of his arrival, eliminate all noise of the washer, dryer or vacuum.\u00a0 Try to encourage the children to be quiet.<\/p>\n<p>6.\u00a0 Be happy to see him.\u00a0 Greet him<strong> <\/strong>with a warm smile and show sincerity in your desire to please him.\u00a0 Listen to him.\u00a0 You may have a dozen important things to tell him, but the moment of his<strong> <\/strong>arrival is not the time.\u00a0 Let him talk first &#8211; remember, his topics of conversation are more important than yours.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>7.\u00a0 Make the evening his.\u00a0 Never complain if he comes home late or goes out to dinner, or other places of entertainment without you.\u00a0 Instead, try to understand his<strong> <\/strong>world of strain and pressure and his<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>very real need to be at home and relax.<\/p>\n<p>8.\u00a0 Don&#8217;t greet him with complaints and problems.<\/p>\n<p>9.\u00a0 Don&#8217;t complain if he&#8217;s late home for dinner or even if he<strong> <\/strong>stays out all night.\u00a0 Count this as minor compared to what he might have gone through that day.\u00a0 Make himcomfortable.\u00a0 Have him<strong> <\/strong>lean back in a comfortablechair or have him<strong> <\/strong>lie down in the bedroom.\u00a0 Have a cool or warm drink ready for him.<\/p>\n<p>10.\u00a0 Arrange his pillow and offer to take off his shoes.\u00a0 Speak to him<strong> <\/strong>in a\u00a0low, soothing and pleasant\u00a0voice.\u00a0 Don&#8217;t ask him questions about his actions or question his<strong> <\/strong>judgement or integrity.\u00a0 Remember, he is the master of the house and as such will always exercise his will with fairness and truthfulness.\u00a0 You have no\u00a0right to question him.<\/p>\n<p>11.\u00a0 A good wife always knows her place.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear &#8211;\u00a0how did you lot get this far?\u00a0 Don&#8217;t worry girls I shall redress the imbalance in\u00a0this article and post an up to dated version later to night.\u00a0 It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve sent to newly weds in the past\u00a0by way of a more personalised gift.\u00a0 Right, now all I&#8217;ve got to do is pick one&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Laters&#8230;<\/p>\n<div
