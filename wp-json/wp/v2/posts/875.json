unblocked by NHS"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>If you live outside the UK you should count yourself lucky.\u00a0 Yes, we have running water and a food mountain that should be shipped to poorer countries on a regular basis, but on the whole it\u2019s us who are saddled with The Royal Family! \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I wouldn\u2019t mind if they\u2019d been voted in, but they weren\u2019t, they just stopped off during a European tour from Germany and never went home.\u00a0 And let\u2019s not forget, marrying your first cousin was seen as a normal practice in Victoria\u2019s day, so it&#8217;s\u00a0no wonder they all look alike.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The misapprehension that most fall under is everyone in England is a Royalist, but\u00a0I can safely say this is not the case.\u00a0 The problems arise when one or a clutch of them decide to have a day out, take a holiday or worse still &#8211; get married.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The entire British media reports nothing else for weeks, and it\u2019s the cap-doffing residence of Blighty who suffer the most.\u00a0 The news breaks and the initial report lasts for no more than 90 seconds, but being British we know what\u2019s coming next and it\u2019s enough to push the sane towards suicide.<\/p>\n<p>The most recent Royal story to blanket the papers and the airwaves was Prince Philip\u2019s admittance to hospital with a blocked artery.\u00a0 You should\u2019ve heard the old waffle we had to listen to.\u00a0 Every syllable of the report was regurgitated over and over again for a five day\u00a0period, by a bunch of salivating Royal correspondents all hoping for an MBE.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I mean, how long can you pad out a visit to hospital for with the scantest of information?\u00a0 If it was your Gran or Nora Splinge from the Oil Slick Housing Estate no-one would give a toss.<\/p>\n<p>The BBC studios were plunged into a panic.\u00a0 \u201cWhat happens if he snuffs it?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cHave we got any black ties in the building?\u201d\u00a0 Oh yes, pick the wrong colour neckwear when a Royal dies and you\u2019ll get a bollocking from head office.\u00a0 Just ask the BBC newsreader Peter Sissons.\u00a0 He had the audacity to wear a burgundy tie when the Queen Mother shuffled off and was berated for his choice.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a decent human being, no one wants to see anyone die, but let\u2019s face it Phil is 90.\u00a0 And to-date he\u2019s eaten the best food and drunk the finest wines in the world, as well as having access to the best medical care.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>He had chest pains and was immediately put in a helicopter and flown to an NHS hospital where they specialize in cardiothoracic surgery.\u00a0 Did he eat the hospital food, was he on a mixed ward &#8211; I doubt it.\u00a0 How would your Gran fare in the same situation?\u00a0 She\u2019d be dead mate.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Still, some good did come from this Royal photo opportunity; less pheasants were blasted to death this year in the boxing shoot.\u00a0 The hospital wouldn\u2019t discharge him.\u00a0 Give a 90 year old a 12 bore?\u00a0 I wouldn\u2019t give him a driving license!<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a
