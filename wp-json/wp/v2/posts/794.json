there I was, old, free and single, when a neighbour said, \u201cOh you\u2019ve gotta try internet dating, everyone\u2019s doing it.&#8221;\u00a0 Yeah well, never being one to do anything just because everyone else is, I eventually signed up on one site, just to see where all this hot action was occurring\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Right from the off, I should\u2019ve known it was going to turn in to a farcical episode in my little life, and I wasn\u2019t disappointed. \u00a0My advice to you, right from the start is don\u2019t bother, unless you want to be disappointed and short in your wallet.<\/p>\n<p>Pick a site, any site there are hundreds to choose from and they all say, FREE to join.\u00a0 However, it\u2019s not until you\u2019ve spent eight hours of your life attempting to download a picture of yourself you realise that they are cost involved after all.<\/p>\n<p>So I began entering some details in to \u2018sadlonleygits-mealforone.com\u2019 and got a message straight away!\u00a0 The very sexy Sandra who\u00a0wanted to speak to me &#8211; way hey!!!\u00a0 Putting my Lionel Blair\u2019s (Flairs) on, my stacked heeled shoes, plus my Brut and a\u00a0rather fetching\u00a0brown and orange nylon wally-collared shirt, I waited with baited breath to see what the brown-eyed beauty had to say for her self.\u00a0 She said, \u201cWelcome to the site,\u201d and that was it!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Forty-two days later I\u2019d finished the questionnaire on my profile and went to bed with a repetitive strain injury caused by constant typing.\u00a0 Well that\u2019s my story mate and I\u2019m sticking to it.<\/p>\n<p>Weeks went passed by and there wasn&#8217;t a hint of a connection with the great beyond.\u00a0 I could only assume that I had a face like a baboon\u2019s bum and no one would bother to message me.<\/p>\n<p>Then, quite out of the blue and some months later, I received an email alert that there was a message waiting for me in my account.\u00a0 This is it, I thought there\u2019s gonna be some hot rumpy-pumpy to night.\u00a0 I went to my profile and saw, \u201cIf you would like read your message, simply give us the details of your bank account and we\u2019ll empty it for you!\u00a0 It was about this time that the swearing began.<\/p>\n<p>So I left it for a while, months in fact, and stumbled on another sight.\u00a0 With the wind in my trousers and both hands down my pants, I proceeded to enter every bleedin\u2019 known fact about me, minus my hat size. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u2018Shagtilyoudrop.com\u2019 seemed different to the other sites I\u2019d viewed somehow.\u00a0 You know, a tad more in your face, brazen even.\u00a0 It was as if you could pre book a lady-person with huge jumper-lumps and they would come straight to your house, even at two o\u2018clock in the morning!\u00a0 I thought then as I do now, how on earth can they keep a free site running without any money changing hands!<\/p>\n<p>There was another long pause before attempting the rigors of another dating site, but oh boy, this was more like it, yes, abottleofwineandagooddvd.com\u2019 was totally FREE, FREE, FREE.\u00a0 And now I know why, it was full off DULL, DULL, DULL women who looked uglier than me and dressed in their mum\u2019s clothes.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve lost count of the man hours lost to this ridiculous pursuit but like a fool I signed myself up for one last time to a dating site called \u2018justgladofashag.com\u2019 and settled back for an influx of banter with the opposite number.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine my surprise when the very next day a message arrived, well worth the \u00a36.50 I\u2019d spent for a weekend trial.\u00a0 The little minx\u2019s name was Sam, and she was bloody gorgeous.\u00a0 Of course she was; she was welcoming me to the site!!!<\/p>\n<p>Message two looked more hopeful, well it had too; after all, at some point someone\u2019s had to ask me a question or mention something about my profile that we\u2019ve got in common.\u00a0 W-R-O-N-G!\u00a0 Not only did she live in bloody Guatemala, all she said was, \u2018Hi\u2019, stupid trout!\u00a0 My sharp senses told me, even in the event that we did meet for a coffee, somewhere in the Gobi dessert; I believe the conversation would be sadly lacking content.\u00a0 Although I was very\u00a0tempted to say \u2018Hi\u2019 back, just to see if she could see the irony.<\/p>\n<p>Ooh, never mention in your profile that you have a mental health history.\u00a0 Me, I\u2019m as honest as you can be, and after looking at some of the ladies information, that\u2019s what they feel is the main requirement in a relationship.\u00a0 So I was honest, I have no need to lie about anything.\u00a0 What happened, I was stigmatised in my own front room.\u00a0 I can only assume the daft bint, with a PhD I might add, glossed over the fact that I\u2019ve remained \u2018well\u2019 for the last nine years and focused all of her attention on the reality that I brazenly mentioned I was bipolar.<\/p>\n<p>The result was this, after number of exchanges through the site and finding we had much in common, she wrote, \u201cI\u2019ll have to sign off now as I simply couldn\u2019t be associate myself with someone who has a mental illness.\u201d\u00a0 What a cow!!!\u00a0 That\u2019s the \u2018c\u2019 word I\u2019ll use for now, but it\u2019s not the \u2018c\u2019 word I used when I read her message.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Last point, if a Miss Oujer-nikya Bolokov contacts you chaps, blow her out.\u00a0 She says she\u2019s 24, a teacher and looking for the love an older man and will travel to the four corners of the world to find him.\u00a0 She\u2019s blonde, blue-eyed and beautiful.\u00a0 No she\u2019s not.\u00a0 She\u2019s a great big hairy Russian builder looking for a passport and if she can\u2019t get that, she\u2019d like you to send her some money!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Well I guess it\u2019s down to the docks for me to see if I can get a cut-price shag under the pier\u2026<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll take this\u00a0opportunity\u00a0to say <strong>many, many\u00a0thank yous<\/strong> to every one\u00a0of you who read my ramblings, and hope in the past I&#8217;ve caused a few laughs.\u00a0 I&#8217;m taking a break now as it the summer, and will return\u00a0on the <strong>4th of<\/strong> <strong>September 2011<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a
