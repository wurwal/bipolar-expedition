great euro debacle"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Money, it\u2019s said, makes the world go around, and there I was thinking it\u2019s the gravitational pull between a bunch of planets\u2026<\/p>\n<p>If this is the case, soon the world is going to come to a grinding halt, and the rumour is, it\u2019s the euro that\u00a0is to blame or should I say the countries that use it, and the twits in charge of finance.\u00a0 Now I don\u2019t know about you, but as far as I\u2019m concerned our Government can take the euro and stick up a slot where the sun don\u2019t shine.<\/p>\n<p>I believe the initial use for this foreign \u2018shrapnel\u2019 was for businesses in the European Union, well if that\u2019s the case why is it circulation on a wider scale?\u00a0 Well, I\u2019m glad to say I have the answer.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, the banks keep saying they\u2019re short of cash, which really means they\u2019re short of our cash.\u00a0 So, how do you stump up some extra wonga for your bank in times of crisis, one of the answers is to make up a new monetary system.\u00a0 It confuses the pensioners for a start, and as we\u2019re all living longer, right there is your source of extra income.\u00a0\u00a0They won&#8217;t be able to work out if they&#8217;re being ripped off\u00a0mostly, and this will generate a greater circulation via over paying people like cab drivers, stall holders and disreputable milkman!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>How else could a bank up its income?\u00a0 Well, once you&#8217;ve fashioned your new coinage thus: 2 and one euro coins, 50c, 20c, 10c, 2, and 1c denominations, in order to avoid the use of the two smallest coins, some transactions are rounded up to the nearest 5 cents!\u00a0 Well excuse me for sounding irate, but you\u2019ve got to be a bloody idiot if you agree to that practice.\u00a0 Sod it, why not just chuck all of your loose change down the nearest drain!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Now let\u2019s take a look at the difference between having a gargantuan debt problem as apposed to Joe Bloggs who is 10 months in arrears with the rent.\u00a0 At a certain stage you notice a lot of letters building up, and they\u2019re all from the same creditor.\u00a0 More arrive, and in an attempt to deal with this financial crisis, you start putting the letters at the bottom of a draw.\u00a0 Yes, even bankers to this.<\/p>\n<p>Then one day the financial minister of, let\u2019s say Greece gets a visit from a friend, who advises him to pop along to a meeting for a chat and some sandwiches with lot of other important people who are loaded.\u00a0 Once there, all of his \u2018friends\u2019 say, \u201cWe understand you\u2019re a trifle short this month, so we\u2019re going to bail you out.\u201d\u00a0 Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-sult!<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd to confuse the plebs, when we release this statement to the media we\u2019re going to say you debt has been \u2018<strong>written down\u2019<\/strong>, rather than \u2018<strong>written off<\/strong>\u2019.&#8221;\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The hope is using this terminology will offset the predict riot, when the masses realise your \u2018friends\u2019 have slashed your debt by 50%!\u201d\u00a0 Ooh, and don\u2019t worry about your job, pension, bonuses, sick pay, health cover and your 16 week holiday package, just look very, very glum when you come into work on Monday morning.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>So, all things being equal you\u2019d expect Joe Bloggs, and man of some means but with a cash flow problem at the moment, would receive the same form of treatment well; it\u2019s only fair isn&#8217;t it. \u00a0Sadly, when you\u2019re at the bottom of the financial pyramid any shortfall in the Bloggs account is seen as an act of high treason and your life is made a living hell.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Firstly, more official letters arrive from a concerned Housing Association or Council, in pristine white envelopes.\u00a0 Like the banker, Mr. Bloggs has so much unopend\u00a0post now,\u00a0he has to find anther drawer to put it in!\u00a0 The only difference between the two parties\u00a0is the head of wonga cock-ups at the bank shreds his.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Then\u2026 the brown envelope arrives, a sure sign the creditor has passed your arrears on to a debt collection agency, \u2018Menace, Menace &amp; Threat\u00a0Ltd.\u00a0 \u201cBetter put that one right at the bottom of drawer one.\u201d\u00a0 You think to yourself.<\/p>\n<p>By shear fluke, you pick up the phone one day, and it\u2019s your creditor\u2019s area housing officer, and by and large the games up.\u00a0 Fortunately, after worrying yourself to death for months on end, the officer is sympathetic to your circumstances, and for the most part the pressure is off.\u00a0 A meeting takes places and a way of repaying your arrears is put in place, without too much of a dent to your income.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019ll still cut into your food and other household bills of course, so Joe Bloggs puts forward a solution of his own.\u00a0 He says, \u201cCouldn\u2019t another borough or boroughs lend me the money for my debt and you slash my arrears by 50%, and I\u2019ll repay the money, say in, 20 years?\u201d\u00a0 The officer stops and ponders on the question and replies, \u201cMr. Bloggs &#8211; now you\u2019re just taking the piss, if we all did that the country would be in a right state!\u201d\u00a0 Here endeth the first lesson.<\/p>\n<p>Note to bankers: stop handing out credit like confetti to people YOU know can\u2019t afford to repay it.\u00a0 And start telling people, if you can\u2019t afford to pay for something with cold hard cash there and then, YOU CAN&#8217;T AFFORD IT!<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li
