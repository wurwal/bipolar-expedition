it was divisible by 240 much bigger pennies, and it was a period when you actually felt like you had money in your pocket.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to WW I, 1914 you could buy a pint in this country for 3d, leaving you with 237 pennies out of you old pound.\u00a0 The \u2018d\u2019 symbol comes from a silver Roman coin called a denarius.\u00a0 And don\u2019t forget, there were 240d to the pound and 12 pennies to a shilling, which now everyone calls a 5 pence piece.<\/p>\n<p>By 1920 the price of a pint had doubled to sixpence or 6d or a tanner, and tanner equates to two and a half pence in today\u2019s money. \u00a0And, at the time, the price of a pint had better relativity between its cost and a person\u2019s wages.\u00a0 Now it seems you need \u00a320,000 plus, just so you can afford a pint in your local.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In my 20\u2019s the pub circuit was the great gathering point, a real social hub.\u00a0 Forget silent friends on a computer, my social life was a live face book page, most nights of the week.\u00a0 I could buy three pints with a pound note and still have 10p change, and 20 Rothmans would cost me 42p!\u00a0 And that was in 1976.<\/p>\n<p>However, it\u2019s not until you get a little older, you realise what\u2019s what in the tax department.\u00a0 You may get an answer to a question you pose, but nothing will change because well, everyone else pays taxes, YOU HAVE NO CHOICE!<\/p>\n<p>A long while ago I visited a friend in Cardiff and it wasn\u2019t long before we were sitting down in his local pub with a pint in front of us.\u00a0 Sometime later it was my round.\u00a0 I ordered two more beers but was astonished to find out the same two Welsh pints were 70p cheaper than the London pints!<\/p>\n<p>And then it dawned on me, I\u2019m on the wrong level of the tax and earnings pyramid, and I and thousands like me are getting belted from all sides, and unless I secure a substantial lottery win, that were I\u2019ll stay.\u00a0 Born free &#8211; taxed to death, and that\u2019s the way it\u2019s been for hundreds and hundreds of years.\u00a0 An educated person could get a little ticked off with that piece of information!<\/p>\n<p>So how can the same product, made by the same company, has such a range in price from one part of the country to next?\u00a0 A landlord will say, \u2018The brewery is in charge of pricing\u2019.\u00a0 And the brewery will say it\u2019s the cost of fuel and transportation.\u201d\u00a0 So logically, if you drive to the pub, you\u2019re getting charged twice for petrol, just so you can enjoy a pint in your local &#8211; a nice little earner.<\/p>\n<p>As we stand to date, the average price of a pint in London is \u00a33.05 and the cheapest pint I could find was a pound in Bridgend.\u00a0 But you\u2019ll be pleased to know I\u2019ve found the most expensive \u2018sherbet\u2019 in the UK, and I can only assume the beer is served by a high class topless escort and delivered to you on a platinum tray.\u00a0 If you fancy a pint get yourself along to a pub Guilford where you can pick one up for just \u00a36.09!!!<\/p>\n<p>Some people don&#8217;t know the difference between ripping and tearing&#8230;<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('\/outgoing\/delicious.com\/post?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbipolar-expedition.local%2Fnever-drink-water-fish-copulate-in-it-fact%2F&amp;title=Never+drink+water+%E2%80%93+fish+copulate+in+it+%E2%80%93+fact');\"  rel='nofollow'  target='_blank'  title='Bookmark this post : Never drink water &#8211;
