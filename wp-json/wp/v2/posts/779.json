a crock&#8230;"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>On first sight my gut feeling said, \u201cOh no, he\u2019s far to smooth, he\u2019s just another eager salesman.\u00a0 What does he sell &#8211; overall false hope to the also-rans and success and more wealth to the already rich.\u00a0 How does he do it, by\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0employing the use of Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) which, according to\u00a0\u00a0the shrinks, lies at the periphery of psychotherapy, as there\u2019s a lack of credible evidence to support its effectiveness.\u00a0 So how does it work?<\/p>\n<p>Overall, it prays on the gullible (N.B. gullible doesn\u2019t appear in the dictionary) who get sucked into the back draft of a speech from a smarmy git.\u00a0 Once a patsy has given unlimited access to their credit card, and the first purchase has been secured, then and only then does the trance of the life coach wear off.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I first became aware of Mr. Robbins during a TV ad, and he was banging on about how I could have \u2018it all\u2019, just by buying his tapes, and this would only take seven weeks!\u00a0 I thought shit; I better buy a bigger house!\u00a0 A week later he was on again, in the early hours, chuntering on about the same thing, only this time I could buy the CD\u2019s, and now achieve the same results in just seven days &#8211; isn&#8217;t technology marvelous!\u00a0 Not even six sheets to wind was I tempted to buy!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>How do you become an obnoxious, fire-walking millionaire &#8211; by having an overbearing mother it seems!\u00a0 According to Anthony Robbins\u2019 sickly online bio, mummy had a \u2018special\u2019 bond with him, but not his siblings, and papa wasn\u2019t allowed to have a say-so in his upbringing.\u00a0 As time went by Robbins Jr. became a sports writer, for which he had a natural talent.\u00a0 But, when mama realised he was becoming a success, and felt she was losing control of him, she put a halt to his early career, claiming she needed him to be at home to look after her.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>He left the family home with nothing, on Christmas Eve 1977, after a massive row with the old bat.\u00a0 Do I believe that?\u00a0 On the whole, no!\u00a0 As a writer of non fiction, I can write an emotive line or paragraph, in fiction, if I choose to \u2018flower it\u2019 up.\u00a0 Why so cynical?\u00a0 I know what\u2019s coming up next, I&#8217;ve seen Robbins \u2018act\u2019 and I&#8217;ve read the complaints that he won\u2019t allow on his websites.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Now, he may have taken a hike from the house and the \u2018control freak\u2019, but, how could you make that sentence more heart rending for a bio?\u00a0 Ooh, I know, add the words \u2018Christmas Eve\u2019, \u2018with nothing\u2019, and, \u2018walked out\u2019! \u00a0Get\u2019s ya right there doesn\u2019t it!\u00a0 And it gets better.\u00a0 His uncle gave him a job, but mummy put the kibosh on that too, saying, \u201cIf he wants to make it on his own, he\u2019ll do it by himself, not by using family,\u201d and convinced the uncle to sack him.\u00a0 Nice lady!<\/p>\n<p>At 22 he was fat, broke and alone and he slipped into a depression.\u00a0 (Wait for it, wait for it\u2026 he comes an epiphany!)\u00a0 One year later he forced himself out of his retreat and took a run on the beach.\u00a0 And it was in that instance that he willed himself to start taking back control of his life.\u00a0 [Author reaches for a bucket, and notes that there was no mention of medication, recovery or any intervention by a mental health professional at all in the bio.] \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Having been infused with the Godly power of self-recovery it seems, Robbins was going to package it and flog it to anyone he could talk into a corner. \u00a0He had some success too, then the seminars began or the second coming of the Nurnberg rallies, as one writer described them, after bearing witness to one such meeting. \u00a0Another said, from what I gleamed from his seminars, he\u2019s almost an evangelist in terms of his stage work and I personally believe he\u2019s pushing a Christianity message.\u201d\u00a0 Now that\u2019s why I find him so annoying!<\/p>\n<p>So, if you\u2019re expecting a nice quiet talk in a cosy room about the benefits of his wares, think again, this is how it works live. \u00a0Before \u2018lanky\u2019 <strong>finally<\/strong> hits the boards you have sit\/stand through the dimming of lights and a warm up guy. \u00a0He runs on stage, welcomes the potential suckers, then twenty or more girls with tight fitting tops with \u201cFUN\u201d emblazoned across their chests join the party.\u00a0 The warm up then challenges the crowd to scream louder, while the fun-babes hand out twenty-dollar bills to the audience members who showed the most enthusiasm!!!\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>By all accounts it\u2019s one long grueling and hypnotic induction, which is over-stimulating, and which is\u00a0heightened by an ear-splitting PA, jumbo TV screens and live cameras everywhere.\u00a0 And right there is the start of the super hype.\u00a0 Just as you think, \u201cGirl I can\u2019t get no higher,\u201d on \u2018it\u2019 walks. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Now you\u2019re encased in Robbins\u2019 world, where you\u2019re profusely encourage to jump up and down a lot and scream \u201cYES YES YES YES,\u201d at the top of your vocal range.\u00a0 While you\u2019re caught up in this skit, smoke machines belch for all their worth and then you\u2019re bombarded with strobe lighting [Presumably checks were made so none of the suckers were affected by this.]\u00a0and a rubbish musical backing track.\u00a0\u00a0At the zenith of the hysteria \u2018The man\u2019 asks you to call up your deepest feelings of lurvvve!\u00a0 Apparently he requires copious amounts of lurvvve, because he can\u2019t survive without it, well that and your hard earned life savings. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Look up a guy called Milton Erickson and check out his \u2018Confusion technique\u2019, it\u2019s part of the NLP method of getting what you want.\u00a0 As is body language, non-verbal communication and the tone of your voice. \u00a0What\u2019s interesting is the way the non-verbal expressions often directly contradicted the verbal ones, and it\u2019s at that point when your bullshit alarm should go off.<\/p>\n<div
