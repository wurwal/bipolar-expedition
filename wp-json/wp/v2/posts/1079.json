The door was locked behind us.\u00a0 I asked him why it was locked.\u00a0 He said, \u201cIt was a standard security procedure.\u201d\u00a0 I remember thinking at the time, whose security?\u00a0 Who in their right mind would try breaking into this place?\u00a0 I went back into the day room and sat down to survey my new surroundings.\u00a0 I didn&#8217;t like what I saw.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>There was a bunch of what looked like child molester\u2019s playing cards at one of the tables.\u00a0 A nurse and a patient playing table tennis, and at the other end of this huge room, were a group of Charles Manson look-a-likes playing darts. What prat gave them a set of pointy sharp things!?!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>One of them piped up, \u201cI&#8217;ve got implants in my head you know.\u00a0 The Russians put them in there!\u201d\u00a0 Oh fuck, I could see it was going to be one of \u2018those\u2019 nights.\u00a0 None of the people on the ward looked capable of offering up much in the way of stimulating conversation, except for the staff of course.<\/p>\n<p>The toilets reeked of cheap pungent cleaning fluid, the bathroom was cold and uninviting, and my bedroom had no privacy whatsoever. \u00a0My bed was hard and the mattress was covered in plastic, in case of an incontinent patient. \u00a0The sheets were thick, starched and cold and the pillows were uncomfortably big. To round off this five star accommodation for the mentally challenged; my bed had a blanket on it that wouldn&#8217;t have kept a baby warm, let alone an adult.\u00a0 I could see I wasn&#8217;t going to get much sleep on my first night in the slammer.<\/p>\n<p>The staff on my ward did their best to help me settle into the daily routine of hospital life.\u00a0 I had already been put on anti-depressants, but after four days I wanted to know why I didn\u2019t feel any better? \u00a0I asked the nurse in charge of the medication why the tablets were not working.\u00a0 He answered with a smile, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, they take two to four weeks to get in your system.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>They&#8217;ve got me now, I thought, my fourteen-day sentence had just doubled in the time it took to swallow a tablet. \u00a0I&#8217;ve seen this scenario before somewhere; the only things missing were the men in white coats. \u00a0I wished I\u2019d never asked the bloody question in the first place. \u00a0I couldn&#8217;t help feeling as though I had been ganged up on. \u00a0Now I was scared to ask any more questions in case my stay in the funny farm was extended any further. \u00a0I was thirty-three years of age but I felt like a frightened child who had just lost his mum in the high street.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>On day five I was informed I would soon begin a course of E.C.T.\u00a0 \u201cOh great!\u201d\u00a0 I exclaimed, \u201cI can hardly wait.\u201d\u00a0 Gingerly I asked what E.C.T. stood for.\u00a0 I just knew it was going to be something I didn\u2019t like the sound of.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cElectro-convulsive therapy,\u201d the nurse replied. \u00a0See what I mean! \u00a0\u201cWell, I&#8217;m okay with the therapy part,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I&#8217;m not to chuffed with the words \u2018convulsive\u2019 or \u2018electro.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It sounded too much like a Hammer House of Horror film. \u00a0Trisha, the head nurse on the day shift, did her best to reduce my doubts about this form of treatment.\u00a0 She then proceeded to tell me one step at a time, how E.C.T. is administered to patients. \u00a0Trish took her time explaining the process, and answered all of my questions to settle my nerves.\u00a0 Even so I still went away with a nagging fear in the back of my mind.\u00a0 (Why do we say that? Is the cerebellum where all of my worrying starts?).<\/p>\n<p>The fateful day arrived. A group of us assembled outside the ward office. \u00a0We were led down a maze of poorly lit corridors towards the E.C.T. room.\u00a0 We looked like a bunch of P.O.W\u2019s being taken down to the cells to be experimented on by the SS.\u00a0 We were shown into a small blue painted waiting room, just big enough to seat all twelve of us.\u00a0 A few silent moments had passed by, when a nurse came in with a small hot water bottle for each of us.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s very nice of you,\u201d I said \u201cbut I couldn&#8217;t eat another thing thanks!\u201d\u00a0 She smiled and explained that they were for us to keep our hands warm.\u00a0 The heat makes your veins stand up which gives the anaesthetist something to aim at, before she puts you under.\u00a0 Still smiling, she disappeared back into the E.C.T. room.\u00a0 So there we sat, the lucky dozen crammed into a room the size of a rabbit hutch, all waiting with bated breath for a swift surge of the National Grid!<\/p>\n<p>One member of the group piped up, \u201cI wonder if we\u2019ll get charged for this on our next electricity bill?\u201d\u00a0 Needless to say, we all had a bloody good laugh at this bloke\u2019s sharp wit.\u00a0 That was the first time I had cracked a smile in ten months.<\/p>\n<p>To have lost my sense of humour was heartbreaking for me; I now know it\u2019s one of my finest qualities.\u00a0 Most of us in that room couldn&#8217;t boil an egg, let alone crack a joke (pun unintended.)\u00a0 Yet faced with a largely unknown situation, we all did our best to make humorous small talk to pass the time.\u00a0 I now know it\u2019s the brain\u2019s natural defence mechanism against blind fear.<\/p>\n<p>Our names were being called out every ten minutes. \u00a0Now there were just five of us left, and the small-talk had all but diminished.\u00a0 We all sat there starring vaguely into space waiting for our turn. \u00a0Then I heard my name called. \u201cOh shit,\u201d I thought, \u201chere we go,\u201d and a nurse led me into the E.C.T. room.\u00a0\u00a0It was large and brightly lit.\u00a0 Inside\u00a0five other nurses were laughing and talking to each other.\u00a0 It wasn&#8217;t quite the Nazi torture chamber that I had envisaged.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In fact it had a nice calming effect on me.\u00a0 For the first time that day, I slowly began to relax.\u00a0 The nurse that brought me in asked if I would like another run through of the treatment. I said, \u201cYes please.\u201d\u00a0 She was so understanding and kind, and could see that I was scared stiff.\u00a0 The explanation of the treatment is a lot easier to take in with all of the equipment in front you.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAre you ready?\u201d She asked.\u00a0 \u201cNot really,\u201d I replied nervously.\u00a0 \u201cIt will be fine, honestly,\u201d still trying to reassure me.\u00a0 \u201cCome on then,\u201d I said, \u201clet\u2019s get it over with.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cOkay, first take off your shoes and socks and then lay on the bed Neil.\u00a0 I will take you through it one step at a time.\u201d\u00a0 At this point the other nurses gathered around the four corners of my bed.\u00a0 They carried on talking away as if they were down the supermarket. \u00a0On reflection, it was this bedside manner that put me at ease with the situation I now found myself in.\u00a0 There wasn\u2019t a dull face in the room, except mine of course.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou will feel a slight jab in your hand,\u201d the nurse said, \u201cthat\u2019s the needle going in for the anaesthetic.\u00a0 You will be asleep for about ten minutes.\u00a0 While you\u2019re under, I will place some electrodes on each temple and give you a measured shock of electricity.\u00a0 This throws your brain into an epileptic fit.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Oh, I could hardly contain myself.\u00a0 \u201cThe nurses around you will prevent you from putting any joints out of place by holding down your limbs as your body convulses.\u201d\u00a0 Sounds like a wonderful experience doesn&#8217;t it!\u00a0 \u201cHere we go &#8211; ready?\u201d\u00a0 I winked at her and took a sharp intake of breath as the needle punctured the skin and vein on the back of my left hand.<\/p>\n<p>Last part next week&#8230;<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a
