The only lead they faced were in their pencils.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s probably just as well the country wasn\u2019t aware that Churchill suffered with manic depression, it wouldn\u2019t have looked very good on paper back then.\u00a0 Position: PM.\u00a0 Illness: Mad as a bear that&#8217;s been poked with a stick a lot.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Hugh Caswell Tremenheere Dowding, on the other hand, was further out of the tree than Churchill.\u00a0\u00a0 He was a member of the Fairy Investigation Society and he believed that fairies were \u201cessential to the growth of plants and the welfare of the vegetable kingdom.\u201d\u00a0 I\u2019m not even going to write the next\u00a0six words, but you can imagine what the Germans most burning question still is can&#8217;t you\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Anyone who wishes to sign up to &#8216;Forward&#8217;\u00a0the bipolar newsletter I write for can do so by sending a blank email to: <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('\/mailto\/ashby300@hotmail.com');\"  href=\"mailto:ashby300@hotmail.com\">ashby300@hotmail.com<\/a>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Just put the word \u2018subscribe\u2019 in the subject box at that it.\u00a0 We cover bipolar and other mental health\u00a0news stories from around the globe.\u00a0\u00a0We\u00a0also\u00a0have a humour section and it\u2019s a free publication.<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('\/outgoing\/delicious.com\/post?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbipolar-expedition.local%2Fi-say-biffos-pranged-his-crate%2F&amp;title=%E2%80%9CI+say%2C+Biffo%E2%80%99s+pranged+his+crate%21%E2%80%9D');\"  rel='nofollow'  target='_blank'  title='Bookmark this post : &#8220;I say, Biffo&#8217;s pranged his crate!&#8221;
