To add to this, in 1989 I was made redundant for the first time when the printers I worked for, D.S. Colour International went into administrative receivership. Twelve years of work ended in one fell swoop one afternoon in January.\u00a0 Six weeks later I resumed work at another firm, only to be made redundant again four months later, a month before Christmas 1989.\u00a0 The icing on my cake of doom was watching my father die of lung cancer on November the 2nd 1990.\u00a0 It crushed my spirit to the point of attempted suicide.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to this, I had been drinking heavily every night for eighteen months.\u00a0 I felt as if the entire structure of my life was falling apart, and so I resumed to alcohol as a way out.\u00a0 The worst part was not being able to control these life-altering losses.\u00a0 On three separate occasions I managed to find new employment, but having a mental illness meant that I was unable to sustain a working life.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Eventually my flat was repossessed and I felt as if I was left with nothing.\u00a0 By then I had moved on from clinical depression and was diagnosed with a bi-polar disorder.\u00a0 I regained some, if not all of my lost marbles and today I am stabilised on Lithium and anti-depressants.\u00a0 Unable to return to my old trade I fell into writing by chance. I found a way of channelling my negative energy and turning it into positive thought. I simply wrote it all down onto paper\u2026 lots of it.\u00a0 I am a special person and I don\u2019t mind saying it out loud now.\u00a0 I survived everything that you are about to discover in this book&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>After reading the first 70 pages I wrote my eldest son, Daniel, broke down in tears. He said, \u201cThat upset me, I didn&#8217;t realise that you had been through so much.\u201d\u00a0 Poignantly \u00a0\u00a0the pages he read were about the beginning of my illness and my first hospital admission.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>At that stage I hadn\u2019t seen my kids for over 10 weeks. \u00a0A short dad cuddled his son\u2019s six foot frame and with a lump in my throat I replied, \u201cYou were only 11 at the time mate, it all happened a long time ago.\u201d\u00a0 In truth, I still remember it as if it were yesterday, but at least it is in the past now.<\/p>\n<p>What saddened me the most was that my disorder had raped me of my passion for music. \u00a0Then it had the audacity to remove my chuckle button as well \u2013 never again!\u00a0 I now know that my sense of humour is one of my finest qualities.<\/p>\n<p>THIS YEAR\u2019S BLACKNESS<\/p>\n<p>I sit here like many condemned to this illness,<\/p>\n<p>What I hadn&#8217;t banked on was all the stillness.<\/p>\n<p>After thirty-two years of row and noise,<\/p>\n<p>I no longer felt like one of the boys.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Sitting in darkness the mind drifts away<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Suffering from years of mental decay.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Knowing tomorrow I\u2019ll feel just the same,<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0I\u2019m slipping, but slowly, I\u2019m going insane.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Neil Walton 13\/9\/99\u00a0 copyright (c) 2006\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>CHAPTER ONE:\u00a0THE LONG LIE IN<\/p>\n<p>I had been on the missing list for sometime; ignoring the phone, the door and the outside world.\u00a0 My mind and body had taken such a battering over the past three years, (1986-89) and I just couldn&#8217;t take it any more.\u00a0 I didn&#8217;t have the energy for conversation.\u00a0 My brain was on overload and my body was paralysed and lethargic.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I had turned into an introvert, the direct opposite of my usual character.\u00a0 My arms and legs were like lead and I felt bone cold, as if my core temperature was lower than any body else&#8217;s.\u00a0 Add to that a poor diet and a feeling of utter worthlessness; I was a sorry example of a human being.<\/p>\n<p>I had a loop-tape of losses and problems to come relentlessly playing in my head. The only thing that stopped this tape was sleep &#8211; the next step was obvious.\u00a0 I was at breaking point.\u00a0 If I could have laid my hands on a gun&#8230; I might not be here now. Only a fellow sufferer or a specialist would understand the mental pain I was experiencing.\u00a0 I found a scalpel blade in my toolbox and went into my bedroom closing the door behind me.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I gazed at the sterilised <em>Swann &amp; Morton<\/em> for hours on end, the loop-tape still playing.\u00a0 I slept most of the time.\u00a0 But there were those awful four to six hours spent awake, going over and over the reasons for ending my life.\u00a0 Why was this happening to me?\u00a0 What had I done to deserve this treatment from life?\u00a0 The answer of course was nothing.<\/p>\n<p>I began nicking at the skin on my left arm just to test the pain factor. \u00a0With a brand new blade it was quite painless.\u00a0 Then I cut deeper into my arm making seven to eight cuts between my forearm and biceps.\u00a0 I watched as my blood pumped from the wounds.\u00a0 I laid there in a cold sweat as it trickled down my arm and soaked into the duvet cover.\u00a0 Sometime later, I reached for my lighter and cigarettes which were on the bedside cabinet.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I was momentarily prevented as the duvet cover was firmly stuck to my forearm with congealed blood.\u00a0 As I pulled it away from my arm, it opened four of the cuts I had inflicted on myself.\u00a0 I remember thinking that this wasn\u2019t going to be easy. \u00a0The pain was so severe that I had to stop and think of an alternative way to end it all.<\/p>\n<p>The options seemed endless at the time. \u00a0What about an overdose of paracetamol?\u00a0 How many would I have to take?\u00a0 If I could have been sure that I would have just gone to sleep and not woken up to being resuscitated, I might have chosen that option.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>As it was, I continued questioning each form of suicide but had no answers &#8211; looking back it probably saved me.\u00a0 My lethargy was so painfully strong that I couldn\u2019t find the energy to drag myself to the chemist, only a hundred feet from my front door.\u00a0 I drank a glass of water, lit another cigarette and laid there wondering what to do next.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I thought long and hard about my sons, Jack and Daniel, who I think played a key factor of my survival.\u00a0 How could I even think of leaving them fatherless?\u00a0 I felt so selfish and yet in so much pain.\u00a0 Suicide or death in general seems so unfair.\u00a0 You die and everybody who knows you suffers in one way or another.\u00a0 What a dilemma, what a guilt trip, as if I didn\u2019t feel bad enough already.\u00a0 I went back to sleep with thoughts of my parents, children and close friends on my mind.<\/p>\n<p>More next week&#8230;<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('\/outgoing\/delicious.com\/post?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbipolar-expedition.local%2Fits-not-what-people-want-to-hear-about-at-christmas-but%2F&amp;title=It%E2%80%99s+not+what+people+want+to+hear+about+at+Christmas+but%E2%80%A6');\"  rel='nofollow'  target='_blank'  title='Bookmark this post : It&#8217;s not what people want to hear about at Christmas but&#8230;
