\u00a0A week later I was still in the same condition.<\/p>\n<p>As time progressed the agony spread its way from my legs, arms and hands and settled nicely in the whole length of my spine.\u00a0 A full night\u2019s sleep was impossible, I couldn\u2019t sleep on my back or my front, and in the end I slept on alternate sides, waking up, on the hour, every hour. \u00a0I started to think that the Irish River Dance troupe had been practising on it for a month.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Eventually, after three weeks of agony and broken sleep, I started getting some answers to my crippling situation.\u00a0 After speaking to the meds man on the ward it became apparent that I\u2019d had a severe adverse reaction to my recent jab and it was called, akathisia.\u00a0 Yip, never heard of it either, but by God I new I had it! \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Okay, how long was this debilitating side-effect going to last for, I asked?\u00a0 Well, certainly no longer than 14 weeks!!!\u00a0 I was given an extra tablet to take with my usual medication to help the crippling effects of the akathisia, but what I hadn\u2019t anticipated was that the so-called anti side-effect tablet had a side-effect all of its own.\u00a0 Three days later I found out what it was &#8211; constipation! \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>A week later, I was still having problems sleeping and was given another tablet to take.\u00a0 Guess what, I now had a new side-effect to cope with, blurred vision, mostly with a tad of extra lethargy.\u00a0 If I wasn\u2019t walking the corridors or circumnavigating the hospital grounds, in small circles I might add, I could be found propping up a wall in the corner of the day room.\u00a0 You couldn\u2019t miss me.\u00a0 I was the blind, bearded, stationary alien with a packet of Ex-lax sticking out of his top pocket!\u00a0 If there is a God, I just like to say, yeah thanks for that\u2026<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('\/outgoing\/delicious.com\/post?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbipolar-expedition.local%2Fcall-that-a-side-effect%2F&amp;title=Call+that+a+side-effect%21');\"  rel='nofollow'  target='_blank'  title='Bookmark this post : Call that a side-effect!
