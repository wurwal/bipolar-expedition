don\u2019t bother.\u00a0 I did it with a group of friends, and all because some bright spark said, \u201cI&#8217;ve hired a boat, fancy a week on the river Thames?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Well, \u00a0the four of us were all in our early 20\u2019s, and it felt like a\u00a0brill idea at the time, so one day during the height of the English summer of 1977, we drove to Reading, Berkshire to bond with our floating caravan.<\/p>\n<p>What I found a tad strange was the boat\u2019s owner wasn&#8217;t concerned that none of us had ever driven a boat before!\u00a0 So rather than a strict rundown of \u2018what does what and why\u2019, and quotes like, \u201cNever do this, while holding these,\u201d our meeting with \u2018Goat\u2019s Breath Mcginty went like this.\u00a0 Cash, keys, and, \u201cSee you in a week!\u201d\u00a0 Presuming any safety instructions would be on board; we spliced the mizzen mast, had rub down with the cabin boy and headed off into the great unknown.<\/p>\n<p>Oh yeah, this was definitely the life but unfortunately, being young and stupid, we had forgotten one basic fact, anything ahead of us would be new territory and we discovered the disadvantages of this when we came up against our first barrier.\u00a0 Honestly, it would have been quicker to torch the boat, wait for the insurance claim to come through and ask the company to deliver the new one the other side of the lock! \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In the brochure herds of locals streamed out of the riverside pubs to aid the virgin lock-openers &#8211; not on our watch!\u00a0 Forty-five minutes later we were still fighting with a lock wheel that seemed to have been welded shut.\u00a0 Did the crews of the \u2018boat jam\u2019 behind us rally round and help us in our hour of need?\u00a0 Did they bollocks! \u00a0So that\u2019s where we left them as we sallied forth and carried on our travels up old father Thames.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>We had been sailing for most of the afternoon, but it was starting to get dark, and it was at this point we realised that we were the only ones on the river.\u00a0 This conclusion led us to believe that we would find a \u2018parking space\u2019 with relative ease.\u00a0 It was a stupid assumption!\u00a0 The reason that we were the only vessel moving at this time was that all the smart-arses had moored up at 4 o\u2019clock.\u00a0 Did our boat owner mention this?\u00a0 He did not, just like he failed to tell us there weren&#8217;t any lights on the bloody boat!\u00a0 Half past seven we parked up &#8211; in the pitch dark!<\/p>\n<p>However, the evening brought about a sense of normality to our day, after we discovered our first pub.\u00a0 We had a great time; the girls tried everything on the top shelf, while my mate and I sampled every pump that had \u2018local ale\u2019 on it.\u00a0 <strong>Lesson one<\/strong>: never get rat-arsed then try and find a boat,\u00a0after nine pints\u00a0they all look the same, even though they were different lengths!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>On the morning of day three there was this smell, a smell that promoted the thought that it should be dealt with sooner rather than later.\u00a0 Well, by the end of the day, and with countless locks behind us, we still had \u2018the smell\u2019, but it was now accompanied by small plumes of black smoke!\u00a0 <strong>Lesson<\/strong> <strong>two<\/strong>: a boat engine needs an oil top-up every\u00a0three days!\u00a0 Did our boat owner&#8230;, oh what\u2019s the bloody\u00a0point!\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>At no stage did anyone say, \u201cOoh you don\u2019t wanna go up there, your boat\u2019s to big.\u201d\u00a0 So we turned right, just to see what was up \u2018there\u2019 &#8211; big mistake!\u00a0 We found a \u2018flock\u2019 of smaller wind and oar powered vessels, and by the looks on the faces of the horrified crews, we had turned into up an\u00a0un-signposted creek minus our paddles!\u00a0 Still, after a 28 point turn, three collisions and one near fatality, we were back on course.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Day four: \u00a0we were all suffering from \u2018lockytitus\u2019, and the first signs of this disease can be seen noted in the Captain\u2019s log: \u201cOh no,\u00a0not\u00a0another bloody lock &#8211; had to eat Johnson &#8211; crew down with scurvy.\u00a0 Overall, this virulent condition is contracted by the toxic pong of the chemical toilet, a poor diet, and travelling at a maximum and mind numbing\u00a0speed of 8mph for five hours a day, with the sun in your eyes!\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>What else could go wrong?\u00a0 We had mastered everything that the river could throw at us.\u00a0 Yeaaaaaaah &#8211; not strictly true!\u00a0 <strong>Lesson<\/strong> <strong>three<\/strong>: if you\u2019re stationary, you\u2019re either securely moored, you&#8217;ve run out of fuel or you&#8217;ve run aground.\u00a0 As we had become accustomed to the gently rocking motion of a boat that was tied up for the night, and knowing we had a full tank, this could only mean we had hit a sand bank!\u00a0 Fortunately for us a large passing tourist boat washed us of in its wake.<\/p>\n<p>Believing we had beaten the trails of river travel now, we entered day six.\u00a0 It was hot, really hot, at least 90 in the shade and my girlfriend was at the helm.\u00a0 My mate and his partner were snoozing up on deck, while I was flaked out on my bunk when I heard this scraping noise initially, and shortly after\u00a0this was followed by a repetitive creaking and straining sound.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I opened my eyes to see part of another boat entering my window, which turned out to be attached to a very expensive yacht!\u00a0 After the female screaming and cries of, shit, shit, shit\u00a0had stopped, it came to light that my ladylove had steered her way into a private mariner!\u00a0 All we had to do now was escape without being sued for a new aluminium mast, park up at our boatyard with the damaged window facing away from the jetty, and we home and dry &#8211; never again!<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('\/outgoing\/delicious.com\/post?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbipolar-expedition.local%2Foars-bores-pillocks-with-poles%2F&amp;title=Oars%2C+bores+and+pillocks+with+poles');\"  rel='nofollow'  target='_blank'  title='Bookmark this post : Oars, bores &#038;
