ooooh no, no, not if you&#8217;re a Walton.\u00a0 True to form, it packed up the very next day.\u00a0 However, the repair procedure was straightforward enough.\u00a0 I made a call to the housing association, they phoned a service company and they called me to make an appointment to view my dying boiler.\u00a0 At the very worst I reckoned it would take two weeks to put right, assuming the service parts were available.<\/p>\n<p>An engineer was booked, but failed to arrive.\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 Maybe he got caught up with a job that took longer than he thought, or maybe he didn&#8217;t get the message to come to my address?\u00a0 On the Wednesday of week one, I received a call from the service company apologising for the absence of their man, as he&#8217;d phoned in sick.\u00a0 Fair enough, there wasn&#8217;t a lot anyone could have done about that.\u00a0 They promised that another engineer would call to assess the boiler on the following Monday between 1 and 5pm.\u00a0 He\u00a0turned up, and the problem was put down to a computer circuit board failure.\u00a0 The guy ordered one on the spot and then left.<\/p>\n<p>Ripper, we were moving forward at last.\u00a0 I was still no nearer to a hot bath and warm radiators but I thought hey, what&#8217;s another week, the part will arrive and someone will come and fit it.\u00a0 What a prat, that&#8217;s what you get for being British I guess, ever hopeful!\u00a0 The circuit board arrived on the Wednesday of the third week and it was attached to a different Mr. Fix it, I relayed my explanation of the events leading up to the no hot water situation and he broke out his tools.\u00a0 He made his check of the boiler and said, &#8220;Naaa it&#8217;s not the circuit board, it&#8217;s the fan and the motor that&#8217;s packed up, my guess is the last bloke that came out saw what the problem was and couldn&#8217;t be bothered with it as they&#8217;re a pig to fit.&#8221;\u00a0 Grrrreat!\u00a0 Man two ordered part two and left leaving me with part one.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>At the start of week five the new combination part arrived at my flat ahead of man three and, when he turned up, I recited the whole sorrowful saga of what had and hadn&#8217;t happened to my boiler.\u00a0 And then I pointed to the ever growing collection of new parts, four more pieces and I reckon I could have\u00a0assembled a new boiler myself!\u00a0 After 35 days without hot H2O\u00a0I was hoping to hear this guy say, &#8220;There you go mate all done,&#8221; but I didn&#8217;t.\u00a0 Instead I heard, &#8220;Ooh that looks nasty.&#8221;\u00a0 Closely followed by, &#8220;It&#8217;s not your fan it&#8217;s your plug, it&#8217;s become depolarised, I can&#8217;t touch that I&#8217;m not an electrician.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Well slap my thighs and call me Brenda, wouldn&#8217;t you just bloody know it!\u00a0 I mean, how the\u00a0hell does that happen?\u00a0 I could understand it if I&#8217;d been fiddling about with it but I hadn&#8217;t been anywhere near it since the day I moved in.\u00a0 Then I remembered my E.C.T.\u00a0sessions, of course it was my fault.\u00a0 Naturally I asked what type of side-effects I could expect after being plugged into the National Grid for 10 minutes but there was no mention that the experience would leave me with the power to fuck up a plug socket just by walking past it &#8211; even if I was bipolar!<\/p>\n<p>Is it dangerous, was my\u00a0first question?\u00a0 What a bloody stupid thing to ask, of course it was dangerous, it was in my flat!\u00a0 I moved the questioning up a notch, &#8220;Okay, how dangerous is it,&#8221; I asked as\u00a0the guy ran down the hallway?\u00a0 &#8220;Just don&#8217;t touch it,&#8221; he shouted as he slammed the front door.\u00a0 Being British I grasped the situation by the throat, I took a close look at the potential fire hazard and then ignored it and made a pot of tea.\u00a0 But I must admit, I did wonder how the placing of a box of cat food in front of the dodgy socket would protect me from electrocution &#8211; obviously this was the most up to date safety measure for the householder and their pets!\u00a0 Week six proved to be the most productive by far.\u00a0 The fourth member of the boiler squad turned up in the shape of a sparks, and he repaired the socket in 10 minutes flat.\u00a0 With this complete I immediately asked him for his hand in marriage!<\/p>\n<p>Right, I&#8217;m off.\u00a0 But before I go I&#8217;d like to leave you with a quote.\u00a0 It&#8217;s something that my great Aunt Gorden use to say to me, and something that I&#8217;ve passed on to my children and my nephews.\u00a0 &#8220;Neil,&#8221; she would say, &#8220;no matter where you are, and no matter what you&#8217;re doing &#8211;\u00a0always keep it damp.&#8221;\u00a0 And you know what, she was right&#8230;<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('\/outgoing\/delicious.com\/post?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbipolar-expedition.local%2Fit-was-working-yesterday%2F&amp;title=It+was+working+yesterday%E2%80%A6');\"  rel='nofollow'  target='_blank'  title='Bookmark this post : It was working yesterday&#8230;
