for nothing"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Did you ever see a\u00a0television series called, The Grimley&#8217;s?\u00a0 It was a comedy set on a housing estate in Dudley at the beginning of the seventies.\u00a0 The heart of the show was centered around a local school where student, Gorden Grimley carried a torch for his gorgeous English teacher.\u00a0 It was a superb piece of writing and it captured the essence of the era perfectly.\u00a0 The cloths, the kids, the parents and the teachers, all\u00a0in a well chosen cast, were cemented together by a dry, humorous and sometimes dark script which was complimented by the music of the day.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Noddy Holder played the headmaster, and Amanda Holden provided the eye candy playing the role of the school&#8217;s English tutor, delicately\u00a0named, Miss Tittley.\u00a0 Throughout the series she was wooed by the sadistic PE\u00a0teacher, Doug Digby, right up until his untimely death in a javelin accident in the gym.\u00a0 As I got to know the characters it wasn&#8217;t long before I recognise a similarity between\u00a0the casts roles and some of my old teachers, particularly the part played by Brian Conely as Doug Digby.\u00a0 Like the character in the programme, my PE teacher was a pig of a man and was built like a\u00a0brick outhouse.\u00a0 Unlike all of my other lessons physical education\u00a0was encouraged by applying humiliation, pain or fear, and in some cases all three in the same lesson in a bid to spur on\u00a0the\u00a0bloaters, weaklings and the thug elements to join in.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Mr Evans was an overbearing Welshman who had Gazelle like ankles, thighs like a brace of tugboats and was, at the very least, the width of a healthy Ox.\u00a0 Quite why he joined a football playing school was never disclosed but I think that was the reason he used to take out his wrath on the pupils, so for him at least it seemed the perfect placement for a practising sociopath, who may have been ejected from the Welsh Guards and was unable to find a rugby playing post.<\/p>\n<p>All we\u00a0 ever seemed to do\u00a0in his lesson was running.\u00a0\u00a0 Cross country was most popular\u00a0when it rained, and in the summer\u00a0we could be found circulating the track while Evens sunbathed.\u00a0 At the end of each session in, how to sweat, we were, how can I put this &#8211; coaxed towards the communal showers by two verbal directives.\u00a0 &#8220;SHOWERS BOYS,&#8221;\u00a0was bellowed out first, followed by, &#8220;LAST WARNING,&#8221;\u00a0two minutes later.\u00a0\u00a0If you weren&#8217;t under, or heading towards the showers a &#8216;persuader&#8217; was employed to &#8216;encourage&#8217; you\u00a0forwards, and this came in the\u00a0shape of the knotted cord which was attached to his whistle and by God it stung if it made contact with your arse.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>There were days of change to our routine over the course of the year which strangely coincided with the weeks that the education board were in the area!\u00a0 At that point every piece of field equipment we had on campus came out on show, and we were let loose with long pointy sharp things, bloody great dinner plates and cannon balls, all of\u00a0which apparently had to be lobbed manually!\u00a0 It was a concept some of the pupils weren&#8217;t adapted for.\u00a0 You knew there was going to be an element of danger surrounding these pieces of shrapnel, especially\u00a0if they were handled by the planks amongst your class.\u00a0 This\u00a0worrying thought was back up\u00a0when\u00a0the most vital piece of instruction stamped on each box was, MUST BE THROWN FORWARDS!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Give him his dues, Evans could chuck a javelin and a discus a hell of a distance, but with his build his was much\u00a0better equipped for the shot putt, and believe me, he would be the last thing you&#8217;d want to see charging at you if you were holding a rugby ball.\u00a0 He chose a victim for the tutorials in\u00a0all things to be thrown that afternoon, and his first choice was\u00a0the speckiest swatoid in the school.\u00a0 He was an absolute wonder with a writing implement and had many, many brain\u00a0cells, but his eye to hand coordination left a lot to be desired.\u00a0 Imagine, if you can, a javelin left in the hands of Frank Spencer!\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Evans gave student Yelland a few pointers in throwing the discus and then lobbed one\u00a0down the field.\u00a0 Mark then picked up his projectile\u00a0while the class took three paces backwards.\u00a0 As it happens he did okay for a first try, it didn&#8217;t go to far but at least it went in\u00a0a forward direction.\u00a0 Next up was the sharp stuff.\u00a0 Evans pulled a javelin out of the ground and handed to a\u00a0shaking Yelland.\u00a0 As before Evans went first and then gave Mark a pep talk before letting him loose with this potentially dangerous piece of equipment.<\/p>\n<p>A sweating swat stepped up to the plate and tried desperately to physic himself up for the job in hand, but he needn&#8217;t have bothered.\u00a0 Evans was on hand to inspire the last few seconds of\u00a0his warm up and bellowed, &#8220;Right Yelland, what&#8217;s the most critical part of throwing a javelin?&#8221;\u00a0 &#8220;Err, timing sir.&#8221;\u00a0 \u00a0&#8220;That&#8217;s right boy, okay class stand well back, this fucker could go anywhere!&#8221;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What Evans didn&#8217;t know was the kid he&#8217;d just left in charge of the aluminium spear had been taken out of his music studies in favour of an extra physics lesson by his parents, as he had no natural sense of rhythm!<\/p>\n<p>We all took several steps backwards.\u00a0 Some, including Evans, took a few sideways just in case, and\u00a0we watched as\u00a0the gangly student began his run up with\u00a0a spear that was trailing along the grass behind him.\u00a0 Seagulls parted in the sky above him as the javelin left his hand, but no one could see which direction it was headed.\u00a0 I mean, we saw it leave his grip but that was it!\u00a0\u00a0We\u00a0all scanned the field to see\u00a0if his spear was still in the air, or had\u00a0 stuck in the grass at a jaunty angle, but\u00a0nothing was the worrying sight we saw.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Even Evans was beginning to show major signs of concern.\u00a0 By pure chance I looked directly upward and against the dark clouds I could see a silvery object hurtling its way back down to earth, and standing right underneath it was the kid that threw it.\u00a0 I pushed my way through a still confused crowd and knocked Mark out of the way and the javelin missed him by a split second.\u00a0 I believe he was the only athlete in the\u00a0history of the school\u00a0to have\u00a0recieved an award for throwing a javelin the highest rather than the furthest.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It\u00a0makes you wonder how we survived our education&#8230;\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Hope you all have a blindin&#8217;\u00a0weekend, and\u00a0let&#8217;s not\u00a0 forget&#8230;\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Never make an important\u00a0decision on an empty stomach or a full bladder.&#8221;\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>All material copy written. \u00a0Copyright 2006<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a
