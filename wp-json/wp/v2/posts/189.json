with the floe"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Errrrrrm&#8230;, apparently we&#8217;re a bit short in the ice department?\u00a0 Well it&#8217;s the first I&#8217;ve heard about!\u00a0 But the Inuits\u00a0of Greenland\u00a0say that they were the first ones to notice the problem.\u00a0\u00a0Burt Inuit, a renowned painter and decorator, was at work one day\u00a0painting a neighbour&#8217;s igloo, when he noticed that his first coat of paint\u00a0wouldn&#8217;t dry.\u00a0 He went back the next day to find that all of\u00a0the wallpaper he&#8217;d put up\u00a0had fallen off as well.\u00a0 Burt is the first casualty\u00a0of unemployment in that area, which is a bit of a bastard really,\u00a0as the nearest\u00a0social security office is 5,433 miles away!<\/p>\n<p>But there is some good news in the offing, the locals can now grow their own vegetables &#8211; whoop-de-fuckin&#8217;-doo! \u00a0Mind you the\u00a0affiliated union of,\u00a0Polar\u00a0bears, Seals and things that flap about a lot, are up in paws and flippers over the issue.\u00a0 \u00a0Another problem that is a\u00a0concern for the Inuits nation is the discovery of gold, diamonds and platinum in the area.\u00a0 They say their land\u00a0could be overrun by prospectors and they&#8217;re worried that the natural habitat and wildlife will suffer as a consequence.\u00a0 I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s the least of their\u00a0worries, you wait until Ronald McDonald and Pizza\u00a0Hut turns up mate!\u00a0 Mind you they&#8217;ll have to rejig their menus to accommodate the locals.\u00a0 &#8220;Blubber and chips for table three Vera, and don&#8217;t forget the Whale sauce luv.&#8221;\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Dear Inuits, have no fear, Bipolar Bill is hear&#8230;\u00a0 Over the last week I&#8217;ve spent literally\u00a0seconds devising a, two point, full proof plan for which I want no thanks or remuneration, unless you can rustle up a fridgefreezer\u00a0large enough to accommodate one small Blue Whale?\u00a0 \u00a0My first stratagem is to place a ban on all motor sports that heavily reply on a circular track.\u00a0 This will reduce the use of fuel being wasted\u00a0and the amount of carbon emissions too.\u00a0 Drag racing will then become the number one motor sport, which will be a sight more bloody\u00a0interesting than seeing a F1 car\u00a0for just\u00a01.2 seconds shoot past you\u00a0after you&#8217;ve just\u00a0spent 60 quid for a ticket at Brands Hatch!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Ploy two, and this is where it really starts\u00a0get\u00a0interesting, would be to target all commercial fights and change the way planes fly.\u00a0 If the trial works that&#8217;s up and running in Jersey as we speak, I hope to roll the scheme out all over the country, and then pass on my findings to\u00a0the\u00a0international circuit.\u00a0 We all know that planes use an immense amount of fuel when taking off, so how can we minimise this waste?\u00a0 Well I&#8217;ll tell you.\u00a0 Coasting, or gliding if you will!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>We all know if you coast down hill in a car\u00a0with your foot on clutch you use less petrol, well my plan\u00a0adopts that idea and applies it to the multitude of planes that\u00a0fly\u00a0above us at any given time.\u00a0\u00a0A 100,000 tons they maybe, but even if they run out of &#8216;go-juice&#8217;\u00a0the buggers will still\u00a0drift into an airport near you\u00a0at some point.\u00a0 A lift will be erected on a runway, a big one, big enough to take a Jumbo jet.\u00a0 The\u00a0elevator\u00a0will raise the plane to a height of about three miles\u00a0where it can be aimed at\u00a0it&#8217;s destination.\u00a0 Then, the platform supporting the plane tips forward and jettisons\u00a0the flying beast\u00a0into the wild blue yonder.\u00a0 This radical piece of engineering will reduce the use of fuel, and the carbon footprint in one fell swoop.\u00a0 No, no, don&#8217;t thank me, I&#8217;m just here to help.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>You know the worrying part about all of this is,\u00a0MY DISORDER IS IN REMISSION!!!<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li
