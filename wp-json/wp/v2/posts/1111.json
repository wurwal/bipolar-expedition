5 of Heading for breakdown No. 2 chapter two"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>My problem was how to launch my projectile without throwing it, because I felt that would have been far too easy.\u00a0 I went through various combinations, finalising them down to three choices.\u00a0 I could have tried to spit the coin from where I sat.\u00a0 Then I thought how messy and inaccurate this might be.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>My second plan was to flick the penny off the back of my hand.\u00a0 After some careful deliberation I realised that this idea would be less accurate than my first ploy.\u00a0 The third option to my mind had the best chance of a successful strike rate.\u00a0 In front of me at the bar was a large ashtray with a hollow interior.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I placed the copper coin into it and pushed it around with my forefinger and thumb.\u00a0 It glided from side to side quite freely, offering little resistance against the enamel surface.\u00a0 The angle of the hollow was roughly 35 degrees from the centre of the ashtray up to the outer rim.\u00a0 I had a missile, a launch pad and now the use of elevation.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>What I was still searching for was a means of propulsion. \u00a0This whim of probability was turning into a full-scale experiment.\u00a0 I wrestled with the physics of what would seem too trivial for anybody else to be bothered with.<\/p>\n<p>I over-lapped my forearms and placed them on the bar.\u00a0 Resting my chin on the back of my left hand, I pondered on how I would complete this, to me at least, important test.\u00a0 At this point the ashtray was right under my nose.\u00a0 As I exhaled I heard the coin wobble against the shiny surface.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I blew out of my mouth; to my surprise I made the penny rattle from one side of the launch pad to the other.\u00a0 The problem now was with the coin laying flat I didn\u2019t have much of a surface area to blow against.\u00a0 I seemed to solve one problem, only to be faced with another.<\/p>\n<p>As a true Gemini I get bored easily.\u00a0 I was beginning to wonder whether using all of this brain power was worth the effort.\u00a0 For something that was so futile, I had become totally obsessed with finding a solution.\u00a0 I took a breather from my experiment and wished I hadn\u2019t.\u00a0 While I was occupied the craving for a cigarette had subsided.\u00a0 All I could concentrate on now was getting hold of some nicotine.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I scanned the bar like a laser, looking for new, unsuspecting customers.\u00a0 No such luck, it was just me, the barman, two blokes leaning on the bar and the old man who gave me the roll-up.\u00a0 Oh, and the little shit with the Benson and Hedges and I wasn\u2019t about to ask him a second time.<\/p>\n<p>I pushed the penny up onto the flat rim of the ashtray, and then knocked it in a few times to pass some idle moments.\u00a0 I stared at the coin that was now perched over-hanging the hollow of the ashtray.\u00a0 For know particular reason I blew into the ashtray causing an up-draft.\u00a0 This in turn knocked my metal missile onto the bar.\u00a0 I was chuffed to bits, silly sod!\u00a0 All I had to do now was blow harder, concentrating my breath to a smaller area.<\/p>\n<p>Digressing back to my childhood for a moment, I always liked to know the \u2018ins and out\u2019s\u2019 of a ducks arse.\u00a0 Never happy just playing with a toy, I wanted to find out how it worked, my Dad was the same.\u00a0 I was given an Etch-a-Sketch on my eleventh birthday, I still have it today.\u00a0 I did the usual squiggles that everybody did, but I couldn\u2019t draw a perfect circle.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>So one afternoon I sat in my bedroom and painstakingly drew lines from one side of the screen to the other.\u00a0 This process removed all of the graphite from the inside and left the internal workings visible.\u00a0 You will have to forgive me.\u00a0 I have now strayed into the areas of probabilities, percentages and an area called, what\u2019s the chance of that happening first time round.\u00a0 Bear with me; it is relevant to this passage.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I dropped a tailor-made cigarette out of my mouth whilst at work.\u00a0 I watched as it fell onto the floor and landed on its side.\u00a0 It then bounced back up in an upright position standing on its filter.\u00a0 I was amazed at what I had just witnessed.\u00a0 Come to think of it, I have always liked the thought of long odds.\u00a0 Mainly because of the possibility that it will come off, it must eventually.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you spin a coin a given number of times, say 250,000 times, you must be guaranteed an even amount of heads and tails.\u00a0 But my interest would lie with the probability that at some point the coin would land on its edge.\u00a0 Back to my glass coconut shy.<\/p>\n<p>I lined my launch pad up with the target area, which was three and a half feet up from the bar and approximately seven feet from where I was sitting.\u00a0 I leaned over the ashtray and gave one almighty exhalation of breath.\u00a0 The penny shot high into the air and hit one of the glasses.\u00a0 It bounced off another, ricocheting off and hit the mirrored surface behind the stack of glasses.\u00a0 It landed on the shelf with still a few spins left in its momentum before lying down flat.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Blinding, I couldn\u2019t find a fault with my project, except I failed to smash any of the glasses.\u00a0 Yet again, I had impressed myself, but not the barman.\u00a0 He heard the end result of my experiment but hadn\u2019t a clue as to what had taken place.\u00a0 So acting as causally as you can with two wet socks on, I squelched my way back to a seat near the fire, next to a half open window.<\/p>\n<p>The sun had come out and I watched as the traffic ambled by the pub.\u00a0 A man with tie-back hair and a goatee beard had begun to collect the empties off of the tables.\u00a0 As he neared my table he asked me if I would mind leaving the pub.\u00a0 I looked him up and down noticing on his sleeve was a Tai Chi club badge.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I just had a gut feeling that he had probably been doing it longer than me.\u00a0 I came to the conclusion that I had outstayed my welcome.\u00a0 Picking up my still sodden moccasins, I beat a slow, calm retreat.\u00a0 Presumably I went straight home, although my mother seems to think I did wonder off somewhere else.\u00a0 Usual story I\u2019m afraid, I can\u2019t remember.<\/p>\n<p>I suppose I must have lost two or three hours to my illness, and the side-effects of the medication, during that day.\u00a0 At five o\u2019clock in the evening Dr Gadhvi had come from Claybury to see how I was.\u00a0 As I recall he was doing his best to persuade me to return to the hospital.\u00a0 But I was having none of it.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>According to Mum I was so defiant that I ripped up all of my case notes, something I have no recollection of.\u00a0 My alto ego was obviously taking no shit at this stage of the game.\u00a0 Dr Gadhvi left saying he would ring at 7.00 p.m. to see if I had changed my mind.\u00a0 In the meantime a social worker was called as back up, so my Mum wasn\u2019t left stranded.<\/p>\n<p>My next memory of that night was four hours later.\u00a0 It was dark obviously, and I now had a flat full of people.\u00a0 Seven o\u2019clock had been and gone and it was now 11pm.\u00a0 What had happened to the daylight hours, and who was the tall bloke with the leather satchel crammed full of paper-work?<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Final part next week&#8230;<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a
