recession solved!"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Just remember: the louder you scream the faster I go &#8211; you have been warned!<\/p>\n<p>From a very early age I discovered I was different from the other kids.\u00a0 I saw things at another angle\u00a0and my\u00a0thought process\u00a0ran along similar lines.\u00a0 I wasn&#8217;t a loner by any means, far from it I just had and still have a wild and vivid imagination.\u00a0 This in itself, over time, fuelled an untamed creative streak which is now about a mile wide.\u00a0 Blessed or cursed?\u00a0 Well now, some 40 years later I know it&#8217;s the former but at the age of five it felt like a curse, especially during the first\u00a0decade of my education.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In the summer of 62 I,\u00a0like the rest of kids were herded and aimed towards the local infants school and I believe now that\u00a0that&#8217;s where my problems began.\u00a0 From the very first day I knew I was in the wrong place but there wasn&#8217;t an alternative.\u00a0 In part it became a torturous routine and the process or those who were trying to educate me, although they didn&#8217;t realise it at the time, crushed\u00a0any spirit I had on a daily basis.\u00a0 So to mask\u00a0my insecurities I developed a highly tuned sense of humour to deflect any incoming information I didn&#8217;t understeand in case I had to attempt to recall it in front the whle class.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fortunately I\u00a0still have those humour marbles even after five trips to the &#8216;fun factory,&#8217; cut me up in a million pieces and there&#8217;ll be a sharpe quip in every single\u00a0bit.<\/p>\n<p>I became the class clown, I had to, it was the only way I could\u00a0survive the day.\u00a0 For the most part I was searching in desparation for an escape route, a comfort zone where I could relax and be myself and after a hard slog I found it in art and music.\u00a0 Sadly it was too late\u00a0for my sense of self worth and confidence, by then I was overly shy and had a bag of nerves that were in shreds.\u00a0 It was clear I wasn&#8217;t going to become and academic but what wasn&#8217;t spotted, right from the off, was my creative talent.\u00a0 In the end I had to nurture it in my own way.\u00a0 It was a rough ride as I didn&#8217;t have a tutor, I had\u00a0a constant stream of odd looks and stares and\u00a0scathing, whinning\u00a0comments such as, &#8220;What do you\u00a0want to do that for?&#8221;\u00a0 It was a hit and miss affair every step of the way but I never stopped trying<\/p>\n<p>Looking back now I can see that a mental disorder was always going to hunt me down.\u00a0 I failed most of the subjects I took in my final year at school\u00a0but always got fair grades in wood and metalwork and art and music of course, so I left the education system fully believing I was uneducated and stupid.\u00a0 Can you imaging what it felt like to then be thrown into the world of employment?\u00a0 The whole\u00a0cycle started again!\u00a0 True to form I upped my game and my quicklsilver wit came\u00a0to the fore again, only now I was in an all\u00a0adult environement.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Five years after completing my lithographic apprenticeship I picked up a PHd in sarcasm and by then I\u00a0was a proficient musician a couple of rungs down from Phil Collins in the early days of Genesis.\u00a0 My crash\u00a0occurred in 1989 when I was 33, just prior to the last recession and the timing couldn&#8217;t have been worse for me.\u00a0 I would go onto attempt suicide and spend the next 2 years trying to fend off the black\u00a0dog and a further 10 years dealing with a\u00a0type II bipolar disorder &#8211;\u00a0my middle name is lucky you know!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As it turned out the discovery of my bipolarity\u00a0was the best thing that could&#8217;ve happen to me, it put me back on the path I was derailed from during my chldhood.\u00a0 However,\u00a0if you had told me 20 years ago I would become a published author and sell copies of my book in America I would&#8217;ve given you a &#8216; there there&#8217; pat on the head and bought you another pint.\u00a0 You know what?\u00a0 I&#8217;m much smarter than I thought.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, let&#8217;s not get ahead of ourselves, right now there are people in this and countries all over the world who don&#8217;t know that they are the next batch of fatalities heading towards a &#8216;happy factory&#8217; and the cause will be the latest bollocks up by the stock brokers and bankers and the only break-down they&#8217;ll be having this year\u00a0are\u00a0the figures in\u00a0their pension schemes.\u00a0\u00a0 Okay, this will probably be the only serious part of my overall blog.\u00a0 In the future I hope to make you laugh as humour is what I intend to move into now, it&#8217;s what I do best, in fact I&#8217;ve never been more serious about comedy &#8211; it&#8217;s good for you.\u00a0 Read my book and make yourself aware and while you&#8217;re at it let&#8217;s see what we can do to offset the stigma awarded to the people who don&#8217;t deserve it by the ones who are largely illinformed!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Gotta dash the cat&#8217;s on fire again,\u00a0 Bipolar Bill (&#8220;,)<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('\/outgoing\/delicious.com\/post?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbipolar-expedition.local%2Feat-the-elderly-feed-the-unemployed-recession-solved%2F&amp;title=Eat+the+elderly%2C+feed+the+unemployed+%E2%80%93+recession+solved%21');\"  rel='nofollow'  target='_blank'  title='Bookmark this post : Eat the elderly, feed the unemployed &#8211;
