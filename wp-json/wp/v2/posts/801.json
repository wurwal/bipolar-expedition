wrong shape?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m sure you&#8217;ve noticed that\u00a0 a lot of oxygen and money is\u00a0wasted in the filming of television entertainment, but none more so than during daytime TV.\u00a0 Quite how the production teams chose what topics to cover is beyond me, and I can only assume they either quaff large amounts of alcohol or take an inordinate quota of \u2018Billy whizz\u2019 (Speed) when they brainstorm their ideas\u2026<\/p>\n<p>I guess you have to put yourself in their shoes for a while and take a look at what they have to work with and who might be their target audience.\u00a0 Students &#8211; well, we can forget about them\u00a0they don\u2019t get up before 3pm.\u00a0 Who else?\u00a0 Mums yes, pensioners certainly, a smattering of the ill and fracture patients maybe, the newly dead and the wealthy housewife with nothing better to do than spend hubbies money by inventing new projects to keep\u00a0 herself occupied.<\/p>\n<p>And it was right there one smart production assistant struck gold.\u00a0 Forget\u00a0 about flogging antiques, bat watch\u00a0updates\u00a0and repeats about ferret farming, aim for the woman-about-town who wants to move to the country, brilliant!<\/p>\n<p>So what do you need to produce such a televisual feast?\u00a0 To start with you\u00a0have to hire a\u00a0&#8216;pride&#8217; of hosts\u00a0who don&#8217;t mind\u00a0repeating themselves every\u00a013 minutes while using every clich\u00e9 in the book. \u00a0(Did you see what I did there?\u00a0 Oh please yer-selves.\u00a0 Next track down a constant supply of\u00a0ladies who live in\u00a0town-houses who are\u00a0more than keen to get their\u00a0phyzogs on national TV and drag hubby along for the ride, and a film crew.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Overall, the episodes of \u2018Escape to the Country\u2019 are clearly for the affluent who love the fact they&#8217;ve got wads of cash and don\u2019t mind shouting about.\u00a0 They are the stars of the show and the host or should I say, victim has to pander to their every whim and need.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Well, to be honest, he\/she doesn&#8217;t do any of the background work, that\u2019s what a plethora of unnamed researchers are for, hence the clause in their contracts that reminds them that, \u201cYou don\u2019t have a Springer spaniel and a brace of Labradors and bark yourself!&#8221;\u00a0 No, overall, the host is there to keep the peace between the \u2018stars\u2019 of the show and the camera crew, because if they can\u2019t make their mind up about a property, everyone has to work late.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The premise of the programme is simplicity it\u2019s self.\u00a0 Smugly rich couples, (the wives) put their names forward to appear in the show because they want to swap from the hurley-burly world of town dwelling for\u00a0a retreat in the countryside.\u00a0 Now, I\u2019m sure the programme makers want to know the \u2018ins\u2019 and \u2018outs\u2019 of their prospective buyers, but really what it boils down to this,\u00a0if you&#8217;ve got between \u00a3450,000 to a mil to spend, so\u00a0they can keep the\u00a0ratings up\u00a0&#8211;\u00a0come on down.<\/p>\n<p>All they have to do is pick one property out of four, which has be chosen for them to their spec, and at the end of the show say, \u201cYip, we\u2019ll take that one.\u201d\u00a0 Do they?\u00a0 Do they bollocks.\u00a0 You can almost hear the film crew in the background shouting to one another, \u201cFrank, put the kettle on mate, the silly bint thinks the wallpaper\u2019s to thin!\u201d\u00a0 So, off we trot along to property No. 1.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The host reels of a load old cobblers, which is set to big-up the couples wants and needs, and in they go.\u00a0 It\u2019s set in two acres of land, there are four bedrooms, the view all round is stunning and the bathroom, living room and kitchen are large enough to undertake a three point turn in an Austin Healey 3000.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Is it suitable for the Pilkington-Smythes?\u00a0 Well hubby likes it, but he dare not say it out loud or in front to his account-drainer.\u00a0 Instead, he waits for her view, and then nods approvingly saying things like, \u201cWell spotted dear, and \u201cI hadn&#8217;t thought of that.\u201d\u00a0 She walks away with her ego inflated and the host bites his or her lip.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s clear to the host who\u2019s the doormat in the relationship and who has her trousers made in Savile Row, and notes she\/he has to up her\/his game with property two.\u00a0 Even before they enter the house the wife grimaces at something and hubby recoils with a non committal look on his face.\u00a0 What can be wrong?\u00a0 Shock-horror-gasp!\u00a0 They have neighbours!\u00a0 Oh well, upward and onward.<\/p>\n<p>House three was the wrong shape, (The wrong shape?)\u00a0the grass wasn&#8217;t the shade they\/she had ordered, and it was \u201cA bit windy.\u201d\u00a0 Imagine that, wind in the middle of a Cumbrian valley!\u00a0 With gritted teeth and a false smile, the presenter walked them through the gates of property four.<\/p>\n<p>Now this was more like it.\u00a0 Suzie (home-maker) Pilkington-Smythe was in absolute raptures over this gaff.\u00a0 Well, she had a half-smile on her face, which is more than she had all day, and this was the cue for her mobile purse to grin broadly.\u00a0 All of the rooms were big enough for \u2018modam\u2019, and the south facing view was a key selling point too.<\/p>\n<p>Yip, for a knock down bargain basement price of \u00a3795,500 or 7955, as we say in the trade to make it sound cheaper, it was a steal.\u00a0 Then, Mrs. \u2018Up-herself\u2019 spotted a flaw in this perfect Des-Res.\u00a0 The house she liked, and the land she liked too, all four and a half acres of it.\u00a0 After taking another Valium, the host asked why she was going to reject this property.\u00a0 Do you know what the silly cow said?\u00a0 \u201cThe house is in the wrong place, it should be a bit further over to the right!\u201d\u00a0 Visiting the &#8216;surprise&#8217; property was cancelled.<\/p>\n<p>In the round up at the end of the show, the host did her best to find some positives in shelling out thousands of pounds in the production of another failed show.\u00a0 And the couples last passing shot was, \u201cWe weren&#8217;t sure what we wanted anyway.\u201d\u00a0 What a pair of arses!\u00a0 Call me Mr. Picky, but surely the money wasted on the show would&#8217;ve been better spent given to a charity that supplies drought regions in the third world with clean running water perchance.\u00a0 Pillocks!!!<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a
