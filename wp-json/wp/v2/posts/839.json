fly-tippers"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Well it\u2019s been just over six months since Japan was hit by an earthquake, and the Daiichi nuclear plant was awash with\u00a0copious amounts of extra sea water.\u00a0 As the initial disaster has been out of the news for a while, you might assume that all is well in the orient. \u00a0You\u2019d be out of your tiny mind you, but you\u00a0could!\u00a0 So let\u2019s have a recap and see if you still fancy a nice long holiday in Fukushima&#8230;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>11<sup>th <\/sup>of March, 2011, the facts: it was a sunny day at the nuclear plant where everything was ticking along nicely.\u00a0 Then WALLOP, a magnitude 9 earthquake shattered part of Japan and this was followed by a 40m tsunami, two natural catastrophes one after another.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The first two disasters alone wiped out 20,000 people in one hit, and destroyed 125,000 buildings.\u00a0 The quake was so powerful it lowered the coastline by one metre and shunted Japan two metres closer to the USA!\u00a0 On the upside, think how much aviation fuel will be saved by the airlines, tickets will be cheaper for a start!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, you\u2019d think that would be enough destruction for one day but no &#8211; enter disaster three.\u00a0 The tsunami headed for the nuclear plant, which went on to cause the multiple meltdown of three reactors. \u00a0This intern released more radiation into the atmosphere than any accident since the Chernobyl debacle.\u00a0 Now, everything\u2019s ginger and peachy, according the Japanese Government, but is it?\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>If parts of Chernobyl are still fenced off and uninhabitable, 25 years later, how can Fukushima be safe six months on?\u00a0 If I didn&#8217;t know better I\u2019d say someone is telling porkies to up the country\u2019s cash flow again!<\/p>\n<p>Still, always keen to take in all sides of a story, here\u2019s what the powers at be and the locals say.\u00a0 The government and the power company say the area is safe.\u00a0 But the locals say so much information has been withheld they no longer trust them.\u00a0 Sound familiar? \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>And as plain as day here\u2019s why the locals have lost faith. \u00a0Ministers have admitted holding back <strong>vital<\/strong> information in order to prevent a panic.\u00a0 (That old chestnut)\u00a0 What that really means is, if there was a panic it would cause problems when notifying the rich and powerful and moving them to safety first.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The day after the earthquake, there was an explosion in the No 1 reactor.\u00a0 A couple of day\u2019s\u00a0later; reactor three blew its stack, and\u00a0the very next morning there were blasts at\u00a0reactors two and four. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>These explosions released a plume of radiation, but the government <strong>withheld<\/strong>projections of its size and\u00a0how it spread up and down the coast and inland to Fukushima city, Koriyama and Tokyo.\u00a0 The call went out and the statement to the plebs was, \u201cDear peasants, there is no immediate risk to human health.\u201d\u00a0 This was an enormous great fib boys and girls.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The full details of what occurred at the reactor site are still emerging and they are far from complete, and here\u2019s why.\u00a0 Government spokesmen initially denied there was a meltdown. \u00a0Safety authorities ranked the accident at a mere four on the international scale of nuclear cock-ups.<\/p>\n<p>Not until a month later did it upgrade this to a maximum seven &#8211; like Chernobyl.\u00a0 Fibbing on an enormous scale children!\u00a0 Well okay, let\u2019s just sweep the death\/loss of <strong>20,000<\/strong> people and the damage to a mere <strong>125.000<\/strong> buildings under a carpet for a moment, which is probably where they\u2019ll stay, and take a look at what\u2019s happening today.<\/p>\n<p>You wouldn&#8217;t know there\u2019d been a catastrophe; the whole area has been cleaned up.\u00a0 But dig a little deeper and\u00a0the changes are there.\u00a0 Umbrella sales peaked due to the poisonous <strong>black rain<\/strong>that fell after the explosions, and Geiger counters are selling like hot cakes that have been eradiated and are\u00a0still warm!\u00a0 And the local food well, most food clicks doesn&#8217;t it!\u00a0 The good news, no-one in the contaminated areas will need an X-ray for the foreseeable future.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Clearly the safety goalposts have been moved and the nuclear figures received a thorough massaging, because what was deemed dangerous 12 months ago is now considered safe and legal?\u00a0 This leaves nearly 2 million residents living in areas where the annual radiation dose exceeds the safety target set by the government!\u00a0 Someone should at least write a stiff letter don&#8217;t you think!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Even in\u00a0Tokyo \u2013 <strong>240km<\/strong> from the reactors \u2013 levels have risen near to a stage where they would\u2019ve\u00a0been marked with a\u00a0radiation hazard warning if they were found in a workplace.\u00a0 Nice!<\/p>\n<p>So, now the dust has settled and the top 50cm of soil has been removed by bulldozers, another set of invisible disasters is emerging.\u00a0 Yes, as usual, it\u2019ll be the cannon fodder of society, the workers who will show the true toll of a disaster such as this.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Now there\u2019s a psychological crisis, which you can assume will go on cause uncertainty and depression amongst the survivors.\u00a0 Most of the local farmers are in despair about their contaminated soil.\u00a0 The young people are\u00a0leaving, and in the past six months there\u2019s been\u00a0an increase in suicides.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Unlike an earthquake survivors don\u2019t suffer with post-traumatic stress symptoms of insomnia, shaking and flashbacks.\u00a0 Instead, the radiation creates a slow, creeping, invisible\u00a0pressure that can lead to prolonged depression.\u00a0 Some people say they want to die and others become more dependent on alcohol and many\u00a0more will complain of listlessness.<\/p>\n<p>But, don\u2019t fret, don\u2019t get down or depressed, all naughty nuclear tackle can be sucked out of the air and heavily contaminated soil with\u2026 SUNFLOWERS!<\/p>\n<p>They\u2019re everywhere now.\u00a0 Is it going to help?\u00a0 I can\u2019t see it personally, but hey, it will brighten up Fukushima until they have to burn the stalks and petals releasing the concentrated radioactivity back into the environment!\u00a0 Call me old fashioned, but isn&#8217;t time to ditch the nuclear nonsense\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Can you hear clicking&#8230;<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a
