Rest assured,\u00a0you won&#8217;t find a leaflet\u00a0about these areas.\u00a0\u00a0And don&#8217;t get me started on the second coming.\u00a0 Oh deary, deary me, what a fiasco!<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0Witnesses grew from the\u00a0American\u00a0Adventist tradition.\u00a0 And a chap called, William Miller predicted that the second coming of Christ would occur on the 22nd of October 1844.\u00a0 And guess what?\u00a0 He was talking bollocks!\u00a0 This day became known as The Great Disappointment &#8211;\u00a0priceless!\u00a0 And you\u00a0might have thought that\u00a0after being\u00a0let down by the &#8216;Big Boys&#8217; absence,\u00a0 this might have caused a certain amount of doubt and a vote of no confidence among the flock and their\u00a0elders.\u00a0 But no, they\u00a0still they carry on with their worship today, even after\u00a0another smart arse opened his gob,\u00a0in\u00a01966, and predicted\u00a0the second, second coming.\u00a0 Honestly, some people just don&#8217;t know when to lay down and die, do they!\u00a0 Thisnext appearance was\u00a0set for sometime in 1975\u00a0, and guess what?\u00a0 The bugger didn&#8217;t turn up again.\u00a0 Well what a surprise!\u00a0 Bloody idiots.<\/p>\n<p>Note to all JW&#8217;s in my area: if I have a bunch of shopping bags under my arm and I&#8217;m just about to walk out of my door, this means I&#8217;m going shopping, and it isn&#8217;t\u00a0a good time to catch me for a chat.\u00a0 If I want a polite and smiley\u00a0one-sided, &#8216;we&#8217;ve gotta leaflet for that&#8217;,\u00a0conversation, I&#8217;ll contact you\u00a0\u00a0&#8211;
