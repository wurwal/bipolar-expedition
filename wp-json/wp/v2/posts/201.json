[Note to self: if your going to\u00a0take the bears some\u00a0lunch make sure you apply for a license first!]\u00a0\u00a0 And I don&#8217;t think it was a good idea to keep open\u00a0snack packets in the tent either.\u00a0 Just an observation\u00a0you understand!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In the documentary Tim baby was, &#8216;praying for rain.&#8217;\u00a0 He ranted at the sky shouting, &#8220;I want rain Jesus boy,&#8221; and eight hours later, it turned up.\u00a0 &#8220;It&#8217;s a miracle,&#8221; he said.\u00a0\u00a0No. no, the weather change mate!\u00a0 The bloke was completely off his trolley\u00a0and was a section paper short of a ward.\u00a0\u00a0 He slept with a toy bear.\u00a0 He used to crawl, on his hands and knees, towards a female bear, with cubs, and start talking to them in a young\u00a0girlie type voice.\u00a0 When asked in an \u00a0interview, was he ever afraid he replied, &#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t hurt me.&#8221;\u00a0 In the 85-year old history of Katmai\u00a0\u00a0National Park\u00a0there had been no fatalities, none, none until soppy bollocks turned up!\u00a0 \u00a0Why, it&#8217;s as if the animals just want to be left alone!<\/p>\n<p>Right I&#8217;m off, I&#8217;ve got a bear\u00a0baiting class at the Haringey civic centre.\u00a0 Well it beats wicker work classes hands down&#8230;\u00a0 BB<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('\/outgoing\/delicious.com\/post?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbipolar-expedition.local%2Fyoull-have-to-bear-with-me-on-this%2F&amp;title=You%E2%80%99ll+have+to+bear+with+me+on+this%E2%80%A6');\"  rel='nofollow'  target='_blank'  title='Bookmark this post : You&#8217;ll have to bear with me on this&#8230;
