missed writing my blog, but when you don&#8217;t have the luxury an agent, you find you have to do\u00a0everything yourself, while\u00a0other things hang in the air.\u00a0\u00a0 However, I&#8217;m not going to add a post if I&#8217;ve got nothing to say, one of my pet hates is bullshit and padding, and I would rather write something that&#8217;s spontaneous, than write a lot of old toot.<\/p>\n<p>So, I have been busy that&#8217;s for sure, and I have to say I&#8217;m quite proud of my achievements in the last four months.\u00a0 Last year a friend&#8217;s mum, who works for Essex Libraries, mentioned my book to the buying team, and the upshot was they ordered a copy of Bi Polar Expedition\u00a0for their stock.\u00a0\u00a0Being slow on the uptake, it hadn&#8217;t occurred to me\u00a0 that other\u00a0libraries might be interested\u00a0in my little story.\u00a0 It turns out I was wrong!\u00a0 What a berk!!!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>What\u00a0began as a casual\u00a0browse\u00a0at the\u00a0local boroughs, soon turned into a full scale London\u00a0operation and, after\u00a0recieving\u00a0a good response, I thought, fuck it why stop there, why not cover the entire UK?\u00a0\u00a0So I did!\u00a0 And that is what I have been doing since the start of March this year.<\/p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t contact every library in every borough, there are literally thousands of them, so in the end I decided to aim for all of the central lending libraries.\u00a0 Each borough has a slightly different way of dealing with an enquiry, but largely if you do\u00a0make an enquiry you have to wait 10 days for a response\u00a0if you contact the council or the library directly.\u00a0 And yes, I&#8217;m glad to say I managed to gain a little humour from my trails.\u00a0 [NOTE TO SELF: tell &#8217;em about Royal Kingston Upon Thames library, and their attitude towards severe mental health disorders.]<\/p>\n<p>So, without further ado, here&#8217;s my library hit list to date:<\/p>\n<p>Library\/Copies<\/p>\n<p>Essex\u00a01 &#8211;\u00a0 Waltham Forest 3 &#8211; Haringey 1 &#8211; Barnet 2 &#8211; Ealing 4 &#8211; Havering 1 &#8211; Southwark 1 &#8211; Richmond 2

&#8211; City of Wakefield 1 &#8211; North East Lincolnshire 1 &#8211; Dumfries 2 &#8211;<\/p>\n<p>Inverclyde 3 &#8211; Angus 1 &#8211; South Dublin 2 &#8211; The British Library 1 &#8211;<\/p>\n<p>Total libraries 40.\u00a0 Libraries considering my book 45+<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Now, after chatting to various librarians, 99.9% had something positive to say about my story, and mental health issues.\u00a0 However, there &#8216;s alway a small fraction that still have the blinkers on when it comes to having a nutter in\u00a0the family, living next door or sitting on their bus.\u00a0 They just can&#8217;t handle an issue that can&#8217;t be cured by money is what it really boils down to.\u00a0 &#8220;Got a problem?&#8221;\u00a0 Throw some cash at it, it will soon disappear!\u00a0 Yeah, if only&#8230;\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>So I sent my standard\u00a0email to the council of Royal Kingston-upon-Thames, and the day after I received a standard reply notifying me that\u00a0my message had been forwarded to the department responsible, and they would be in touch within 10 days.\u00a0 And 10 days later, sure enough,\u00a0there was a reply to my humble enquiry.\u00a0 It read thus:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Dear pleb,<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for submitting your enquiry regarding your first book about how mental you were, (my, that must have been embarrassing for you).\u00a0\u00a0 We do have a section on self-help, (we\u00a0don&#8217;t put\u00a0it under the heading of&#8217; mental health as it would upset our clientele who are well and loaded)\u00a0or (well loaded).\u00a0 So we prefer to deal with only\u00a0mild to moderate disorders, as it&#8217;s a lot less embarrassing for all concerned.\u00a0\u00a0But, on the upside, we do hold a raffle for\u00a0the bankers in the next town who are suffering from a lack of\u00a0interest in life, and\u00a0on their accounts\u00a0due to the credit crunch, and that makes us feel better about our inadequacies in dealing with real life situation.\u00a0\u00a0I shall certainly consider your book (snigger snigger) when we empty out the bins or when I&#8217;ve got &#8216;one of my heads&#8217;.\u00a0\u00a0 And thank you for making us aware of your tatty little literary offering.\u00a0\u00a0So I said&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Dear Never &#8216;ad a chip sarney in yer life,<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for such a swift and positive reply, you scabby old bat.\u00a0 I hope my book, &#8216;Bi Polar Expedition&#8217;\u00a0is considered for the libraries of Kingston upon Thames, as a large majority of men and women are not lucky enough to escape with just mild to moderate disorders, some have to sack their butlers and housemaids, and their cook and nanny as well.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Mental ill health is a classless condition, and it is partly the reason I wrote about my experiences but, if you feel lucky, and\u00a0believe you will escape being\u00a0associated with\u00a0the &#8216;1 in 4&#8217; (riff raff who become\u00a0ill\u00a0because they have no money)\u00a0don&#8217;t order a copy of my story. \u00a0I mean, we wouldn&#8217;t want to upset\u00a0anyone would we.<\/p>\n<p>Wishing you, all you wish yourself (you\u00a0sanctimonious git)<\/p>\n<p>Luv&amp;&#8217;ugs &amp; a grope behind the bins, The Spaz from Alcatraz, oarfer\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>No earlobes member No. 19.\u00a0 Patrick
