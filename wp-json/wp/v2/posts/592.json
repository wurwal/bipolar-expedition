marquees&#8230;\u00a0 This story\u00a0is a life-lesson, and shows\u00a0the uses and advantages of being totally off your trolley.\u00a0 \u00a0Please note: this is a true story from WW II.\u00a0 Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerp<\/p>\n<p>We needed a plan, a plan to dupe the Hun into believing that we were going to\u00a0take Greece, rather than the glaringly obvious Sicily.\u00a0 &#8220;What to do,&#8221; said our brandy swilling Churchill.\u00a0\u00a0 &#8220;I know, let&#8217;s see what Intelligence can come with.&#8221;\u00a0 So he did.\u00a0 Beavering away there\u00a0was a young Ian &#8216;007&#8217; Fleming, and he had been compiling\u00a0a list\u00a0of radical ways to deceive the enemy, and it was\u00a0suggestion No. 28\u00a0that caught our leaders attention.\u00a0 It was\u00a0 without doubt, a very British wizard prang idea, and Churchill said, &#8220;Hmmm, sounds like a plan!&#8221;\u00a0 So from that point it was all, chocks away and tell\u00a0yer mother ninepence!<\/p>\n<p>Now, on Jerry&#8217;s side was a Spanish fisherman, two high ranking spies, a Mr &#8216;Gobby&#8217; Goebbels, and one Adolf &#8216;I like a good shout me&#8217; Hitler.\u00a0 And on our side we had Mr Fleming, a Royal Navy Commander, who didn&#8217;t go to sea, and an RAF pilot who didn&#8217;t fly!\u00a0 And on the subs bench was a pathologist called, (I kid you not) Sir Bentley Purchase, and our star striker &#8211; one dead Welshman!<\/p>\n<p>The whole bizarre scheme all hinged a stiff, the right sort of stiff, and it had to be a fresh one.\u00a0 He had to have died in the &#8216;right way&#8217;, so the German pathologists wouldn&#8217;t smell a rat.\u00a0 The plan was to dropped a body, dressed as a Major in the Marines, into Spanish waters.\u00a0 It would have a briefcase loaded up with, what looked like top secret documents, and he would also have a wallet stuffed with fake personal details.\u00a0 The hope was that the body would find its way into enemy hands, and the duff information would filter its way up to Mr Shouty.<\/p>\n<p>Well now then and then some, they found their boy, all thanks to &#8216;Gently&#8217; Bentley Purchase, but what a tragic back story.\u00a0 \u00a0The guy they found was the son of a minor, and after his pit was closed downed, because the coal had run out, he topped himself.\u00a0 This left Glyndwr Michael (pronounced, Glyndur) and his mother in a village that was slowly dying.\u00a0 Then, a short time later Glyndwr&#8217;s mother died, well happy bloody Christmas!\u00a0 By this stage he was homeless, penniless and friendless, and had drifted to London.\u00a0 In 1943 his body was discovered in a disused warehouse, where he had killed himself using rat poison &#8211; H-a-p-p-y fucking New Year!!!<\/p>\n<p>Now it was time\u00a0for our boys to do their stuff, but why did Winston &#8216;where&#8217;s the brandy&#8217; Churchill pick these two particular men to work on, what would come to be known as &#8216;Operation Mincemeat&#8217;?\u00a0 Well, they were both highly ranked officers and both were fairly young, but the key factor was, they\u00a0didn&#8217;t think in straight lines.\u00a0 In short, they were both barking mad!<\/p>\n<p>Ewen Montagu, the matelot minus a minesweeper, was chosen because he was an eminent barrister, and had a remarkable skill for spotting bullshit.\u00a0 And Charles, (wait for it) Cholmondeley, (Pronounced, Chumley!) the fly-boy who didn&#8217;t, was employed because he had a superb waxed moustache and a very peculiar mind.\u00a0 On his days off, for example, he studied the mating habits of insects, and if his was really bored, he hunted partridges with a revolver!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Our fine and\u00a0well educated mentals had three months to invent a whole new personality for the relatively newly dead man.\u00a0 He was given a bank account, and a bollocking letter from his bank manger, stating that his overdraft would be called in if he didn&#8217;t start slapping some folding money in his account pronto.\u00a0 He gained a girlfriend and was carrying a ring worth, \u00a313, 000\u00a0in today&#8217;s money.\u00a0 And I think he even had a Mayfair address too.<\/p>\n<p>Well he had done well for himself!\u00a0 Two weeks after he was dropped into Spanish waters, via submarine, the news had reach the bloke with a stolen logo.\u00a0 The telegraph from Bletchley Park read: Operation Mincemeat swallowed hook, line and sinker.\u00a0 You have to laugh at the front and nerve of the men involved!\u00a0 Churchill was bipolar.\u00a0 Our &#8216;Brill-cream boy&#8217; was a plane short of a fuselage, and our sailor had spent more time in court than the sea!\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Can you imagine the scene?\u00a0 While Hitler was moving everything he had from Sicily to Greece, by sea, air, rail\u00a0and road,\u00a0British Intelligence were organising a piss-up to Blackpool.\u00a0 And when\u00a0Jerry reached Greece, they couldn&#8217;t understand why it was so quiet!\u00a0 \u00a0Abso-frigging-lutely brilliant.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The full story is told in the film, The man that never was.\u00a0 It&#8217;s got to worth a look hasn&#8217;t it?<\/p>\n<p>Right, I&#8217;m off, I&#8217;ve got a reindeer to sand down.\u00a0 Catch you all in the New Year sometime&#8230;<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul
