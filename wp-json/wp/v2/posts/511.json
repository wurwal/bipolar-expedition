of a beach hut!"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>There&#8217;s no two ways about it.\u00a0 It&#8217;s a bloody\u00a0box, a very basic bloody\u00a0box, no more than 12 x 8.\u00a0 There&#8217;s no bath, no electric or mains gas, or even a toilet.\u00a0\u00a0So how the fuck can someone validate charging over 25 grand for one?\u00a0 Moreover, what prat would shell out that amount of cash for a nesting box for an\u00a0ostrich!\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>A hundred and fifty years ago they were called bathing machines and were on wheels.\u00a0 Well the overly rich had them, the riff raff just had to look on from a safe distance, usually\u00a0the next resort!\u00a0 When a doctor came up with the idea of\u00a0a freezing cold dip in saltwater, as a &#8216;cure-all&#8217; remedy for everything, even amputation, the Royal family started to get interested in\u00a0this newest of inventions.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>No one had used the beaches\u00a0on the coasts of Britain, accept sailors and smugglers, that was\u00a0until George the\u00a0III\u00a0gave his approval in 1789.\u00a0\u00a0There are no records to prove\u00a0whose idea it\u00a0was for the bathers\u00a0to\u00a0take a dip\u00a0fully clothed.\u00a0 In\u00a0 the 1790&#8217;s the stiff upper-lipped were keen to have mixed bathing, dirty devils!\u00a0 As usual the upper crust rich Brits were lagging behind Europe and America in this department, as they had been doing it for years, dirty, dirty devils!\u00a0 Then it was deemed that the English could have such rights, the ladies would bathe on Mondays and the gents on the Wednesday, but on the same beach!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Scarborough was the first resort were the promenade was decked with rabbit hutches.\u00a0 And Queen Victoria had her own personal bathing machine in Osborne, on the Isle of Wight.\u00a0 A horse would pull the machine down to the sea were\u00a0 she could splash about\u00a0to\u00a0her hearts content.\u00a0 The only problem with this arrangement was, that most of the horses drowned as a result of being shackled to the front of the contraption.\u00a0 Breathing apparatus for horses\u00a0sadly never caught on.<\/p>\n<p>It was in the 50&#8217;s that the humble beach hut really took off.\u00a0 The wheels were removed and you could buy or hire your very own badly painted\u00a0wooden box.\u00a0 Now, the cost of rental or purchase all\u00a0depends on\u00a0where your hut is\u00a0sited.\u00a0\u00a0 And\u00a0it is still very much a class divide\u00a0issue.\u00a0 Take Frinton for example, the retirement capital of England.\u00a0 It shuts at 6:30pm, there are no pubs or night clubs, but there\u00a0are plethora of hotels, if two constitutes a plethora!\u00a0 And bloody and, let&#8217;s not forget\u00a0the only wine bar for miles.\u00a0(also shuts at 6:30pm)<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, let&#8217;s have a shufty at\u00a0the\u00a0comparison in prices\u00a0between two resorts.\u00a0 In Frinton you can pay anything between 15 and30 thousand for\u00a0a\u00a0sand box.\u00a0 Peak hiring cost: \u00a3350 per week.\u00a0 Off peak: \u00a3349.53 per week.\u00a0 Entertainment:\u00a0 watching the grass grow, chasing a pickle around your plate,\u00a0and saying, &#8220;Oh bollocks, my colostomy bag is full.&#8221;\u00a0 Toilets,\u00a0250 metres away.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s take a look at a cheaper model in Shiteminster-on-the-bog.\u00a0 The materials are just the same and so is the size.\u00a0 Peaking hiring cost:\u00a0four bob.\u00a0\u00a0Off peak: a tanner.\u00a0\u00a0Entertainment: nicking the lead off the posh huts,\u00a0Tasering the kids,\u00a0and saying, &#8220;Jesus, I could do with shit.&#8221;\u00a0 Toilets next resort along, near the minefield.<\/p>\n<p>Press release from Frinton hire and buy agent: Forget cocktails in the Caribbean, and sailing in the south of France, it&#8217;s difficult to beat Frinton for a traditional seaside holiday!\u00a0 Have you ever heard such a crock of horseshit!<\/p>\n<p>Press release from Filthmuck-on-sea agent: Forget having a slash in the lift at home, or shooting-up in a stairwell,\u00a0 come\u00a0to Filthmuck-on-sea and do it in the sea!\u00a0 Well at least it&#8217;s an honest approach!\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Right I&#8217;m off, my toilet duck has drowned and I&#8217;m thinking of dreding my pubes&#8230; BB<\/p>\n<div
