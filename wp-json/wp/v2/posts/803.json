dedicated follower of crap"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re old enough to remember Twiggy, you\u2019ll recall she was no wider that a coat hanger, and since the 60\u2019s of swing, model-wise at least, nothing has really change except the bizarre efforts of the fashion designers\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Well no, two things have altered over the years as it goes, there\u2019s now a \u2018lard arse\u2019 range to appease the bloaters of society who can\u2019t stop forcing Mc Donald\u2019s down their necks, and the re-touching guys still have a license to shave pounds of off a model by doctoring the pictures. \u00a0And the next thing you know an eight year old girl says to her mum, \u201cI need to go on a diet if I\u2019m going to look like Kate Moss,\u201d and a browbeaten mother replies, \u201cI\u2019ll get some cigarettes, strong coffee and a bag of coke for you tomorrow dear!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m not sure who\u2019s the worst, the designers or the celebrities that buy their clothes, then fawn all over them for producing a master piece for them.\u00a0 Alex McQueen was a prime example; local boy makes good, but even he ended up brown bread (dead).\u00a0 There\u2019s no doubt that his earlier pieces were the work of a craftsman, well he did learn his trade in Savile Row after all, and in short he was the dogs wotsits at a very young age.\u00a0 But it all seems to go breasts upper most when fame and fortune catches up with these people.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Have you seen what comes down the catwalk lately?\u00a0 More importantly, have you seen the piece worn anywhere else?\u00a0 I mean, if you want to wear something that looks like green marzipan with a chandelier dumped on your bonce, you help yourself.\u00a0 It\u2019ll probably only set you back 12,000 grand and rest assured, no one down the supermarket will be wearing the same mess.\u00a0 In fact I doubt whether you\u2019ll find an occasion to wear the bloody thing in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>So, as a hot-shot designer with a bundle in the bank, you can really let loose with your creative side, knowing full well that some twit with more money than sense will buy what ever you make for them.\u00a0 Would you buy a neck scarf for 300 big ones?\u00a0 Well that\u2019s what happens when you have your own brand name, you can charge what you like!\u00a0 However, when this occurs you find yourself at parties three times a week and a whole bunch of new \u2018friends\u2019 whose main intent is to supply you with as much Colombianmarching powder as you can stick up your schnoz.<\/p>\n<p>Well, how odd, the McQueen range suddenly went into overdrive, and his work became more and more farcical.\u00a0 I\u2019m still trying to discover who thought it would be a great idea to purchase a dress that looked as if it had been fashioned out of carpet off-cuts &#8211; in purple!\u00a0 I mean, you can actually see the cocaine at work.\u00a0 Oh yeah, I can stay up for three days straight and design a dress, the trouble is I\u2019m pretty sure no one would look twice at my matching Swiss roll meets brown\u00a0 Plasticine ensemble or would they?\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Other pieces of McQueen\u2019s work have been described as thus: from the autumn range, \u201cA dress with a floral embellishment.\u201d\u00a0 I kid you not; it was a bush, with leaves and twigs included!\u00a0 Next; \u201cA white coral reef skirt.\u201d\u00a0 Yip, if it wasn&#8217;t a recently under cooked omelette, then I&#8217;ve got two bottoms!\u00a0 And what was he on when he thought that designing a pink boiler suit with a snood and a gas mask was a good idea!\u00a0 Moreover, who agreed with him when he slapped the first sketch down on the table?<\/p>\n<p>Honestly, these people get so far up themselves they can\u2019t see the dress for the trees!\u00a0 And what about the models?\u00a0 Well, they\u2019re young and will probably wear anything for the right money, but all the same, what a life.\u00a0 All are hoping to be the next top catwalk queen, but in the run up to that coke-fuelled position, they\u2019re pushed and pulled about, makeup is slapped all over their heads and they have to subscribe to a diet of a lettuce leaf\u00a0and 400 cigarettes a week.\u00a0 So it\u2019s no surprise when they lose the will to smile.<\/p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter what I say because the clothes cattle market will carry on long after I\u2019m in my box.\u00a0 And if your wife or partner wants to dress up in a matching two-piece \u2018Borrowers\u2019 outfit, let her get on with it.\u00a0 In fact, get yourself one; it\u2019ll give the members of the Rotary Club something to talk about.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Rest assured, you\u2019ll know if you&#8217;ve been to a high class catwalk show, all you have to do is check the maximum load sign in the lift.\u00a0 Instead of stating it can carry 1000lbs or eight people &#8211; it\u2019ll say 1000lbs or 36 models!<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a
