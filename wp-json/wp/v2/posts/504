knocked out his first piece titled, The Barefoot Girl, and for a 14 year old it wasn&#8217;t to shabby.\u00a0 There were a string family paintings undertaken, but really when all said and done, he would&#8217;ve been better off with using\u00a0a Kodak Prat-o-Matic.\u00a0 He dabbled in still life for a while, and then\u00a0slipped into the &#8216;ugly porn&#8217; years I&#8217;m afraid, which is a awful way to see your Aunt Nelly.\u00a0\u00a0Terrible mess really.\u00a0 In 1907\u00a0money was tight, so\u00a0he commissioned himself to paint\u00a0a self portrait, and to be honest it was a shame, because\u00a0it looked more like Fred Flintstone than\u00a0anyone.<\/p>\n<p>Judging by the colours and shapes in, Clarinet and Violin and, Still Life and Guitar I can only assume that he was beginning to lose the plot altogether, because I&#8217;m sure he did a series of\u00a0potato prints!\u00a0 And by the time he painted, Bather Opening a Cabin I&#8217;m fairly sure he was\u00a0 in regression therapy.\u00a0 I kid you not, it looks like a horse with a key! \u00a0A stroke victim with a blindfold could have done a better job.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In 1927 Pab baby was really cooking on gas when he did a painting called, Nude on a Beach.\u00a0 Well I&#8217;m sorry, but\u00a0a bigger load of old tat you&#8217;ve never seen before.\u00a0 Imagine, if you can, a new Mr Men\u00a0character called, Mr\u00a0Clubfooty-squarebottom,\u00a0with a tiny round head,\u00a0enclosed in a rude hut.\u00a0 And he carried on in this style with his next piece, which he called, Young Girl Throwing a Rock, painted in 1931.\u00a0 Oh dear oh dear oh dear!\u00a0 If, at one time, it was a girl lobbing a small boulder, I can only assume that the artist thought, &#8220;Fuck it, I know what I&#8217;ll do,\u00a0I&#8217;ll cut it up with a pair of garden shears and slap the bits\u00a0on another canvass.&#8221;\u00a0 So he did.\u00a0 I still\u00a0find it hard to believe Picasso was never sued under the trades descriptions act!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>There were a series\u00a0of paintings where, I&#8217;m sure,\u00a0Picasso must have been experimenting with &#8216;happy mushrooms&#8217;.\u00a0 I mean, if you can&#8217;t put\u00a0the eyes, the nose, the mouth and ears in the right place, it&#8217;s time to get a proper job isn&#8217;t it?\u00a0 His old\u00a0toot is still on sale would you believe!\u00a0 And somewhere, someone, is sitting in a darkened room right now\u00a0 salivating over their collection of Picasso&#8217;s lino prints.\u00a0 While somebody, somewhere\u00a0else is dying\u00a0because they haven&#8217;t got enough water to drink&#8230;\u00a0 Nuff said.<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('\/outgoing\/delicious.com\/post?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbipolar-expedition.local%2Fpablo-two-coats-one-afternoon-picasso%2F&amp;title=Pablo+%E2%80%98two+coats+%E2%80%93+one+afternoon%E2%80%99+Picasso');\"  rel='nofollow'  target='_blank'  title='Bookmark this post : Pablo &#8216;two coats &#8211;
