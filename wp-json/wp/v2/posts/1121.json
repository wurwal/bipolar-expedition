it was most disconcerting.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Was all this part of an elaborate wind up?\u00a0 It was pissing me off no end.\u00a0 Although I was heavily medicated, through my blurred vision, no doubt a side-effect of the drugs, I could just make out somebody walking towards me and waving.\u00a0 Wouldn&#8217;t you know it; it was Bill, smiling from ear to ear.<\/p>\n<p>My first and most obvious question to him was, \u201cHow long have I been here?\u201d\u00a0 His reply did not compute on first hearing.\u00a0 \u201cRun that by me one more time?\u201d\u00a0 I said in total dismay.\u00a0 He repeated his answer.\u00a0 \u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, that\u2019s not possible surely?\u201d\u00a0 I felt around my face to discover that I had almost got a fully grown beard.\u00a0 That would explain this I suppose.\u00a0 Bill nodded in agreement.\u00a0 He looked embarrassed, as if it was his fault I was in hospital again.<\/p>\n<p>I chain-smoked for the next hour or so, still coming to terms with the length of time that I had been incarcerated.\u00a0 Bill informed me that it was the hospitals\u2019 decision not to allow anybody to see me as I was far too high.\u00a0 I had been unaware of my surroundings to the tune of 408 hours.\u00a0 What my poor Mum must have gone through.\u00a0 I couldn&#8217;t believe that it had taken that amount of time to get me in a reasonably coherent state again.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Bill left saying he would visit me again soon.\u00a0 I sat in a state of confusion for quite sometime, trying without success to piece back together the last 17 days of my life.\u00a0 Who washed and dressed me?\u00a0 Where did I sleep, did someone have to feed me?\u00a0 Ninety-nine point nine percent of those two and a half weeks is still a blank today.\u00a0 What I can remember I can\u2019t even bear to put down on paper.<\/p>\n<p>And you&#8217;d think it couldn&#8217;t get any worse &#8211; wrong!<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>General information<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>After five break-downs I went on to write a book about my experiences, and in 2007 &#8216;Bi Polar Expedition&#8217;
