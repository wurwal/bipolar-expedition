Welcome to England in the 1970\u2019s&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Aah yes, those were the days, we had the miner\u2019s strikes, a three day week, the worst fashion in history since the doublet and hose and the longest, hottest summer for years.\u00a0 And I\u2019m not just saying this because I was there, but there was something definitely special about this period in history.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The seasons of the year fell in the correct part of the calendar for a start.\u00a0 The metrication system\u00a0was introduced in 1971 to confuse the old and devalue the pound over night.\u00a0 And the best way to show this effect is thus: a sliced white loaf would set you back 19p and twenty Rothmans cost 42p, and I can clearly remember enjoying a cigarette, IN A PUB, with beer that I paid 32p for.\u00a0 Yes, three pints for a quid!\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Sounds cheap, doesn&#8217;t it!\u00a0 Well it does as long as you don\u2019t look back and then take\u00a0into consideration, at a very basic level, the price of a Mars bar then and now.\u00a0\u00a0 Then it was a tanner, sixpence, two and a half new pence.\u00a0 Today the same item costs 60p or 11\/- shillings in real money.\u00a0 And bearing in mind there were 20 shillings to the pound then, you can how things have changed.<\/p>\n<p>The fashion of the era\u00a0was a disaster.\u00a0 I can only assume the economic boom at the time gave the designers more material to play with\u00a0so they added it to men&#8217;s trousers!\u00a0 And boy did we think we were cool in our 28 inch bell bottoms and three inch waist bands!\u00a0\u00a0 And let\u2019s not forget the obligatory platform shoes or boots!\u00a0 It was about this time the Fashion Police was formed!\u00a0 The sad part about this was people actually attended parties dressed in this rubbish!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>And what did we drink?\u00a0 Well by and large that\u2019s a secret.\u00a0 The wine, for the little lady, had a high proportion of antifreeze in it, but as no one died and most made it through the British winter untouched by frostbite, the Government approved the sales.\u00a0 But, the blokey-blokes of the day were had over big time.<\/p>\n<p>Any form of bag carrying was seen as the first steps to homosexuality, so how did you get your beer to a party?\u00a0 Well, Watneys had the answer &#8211;\u00a0The Party Seven tin.\u00a0 Yep, seven pints at the cost of a nifty 15\/- shillings or 75p to you youngsters, and it was carried under an arm, with a stack of records under the other.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>You never actually got to drink the whole of contents though.\u00a0 Most people walked in those days and right there was the reason.\u00a0 Warm beer being slopped about for a mile or so caused havoc in the kitchen.\u00a0 You arrived, looked for a hammer and a screwdriver and the first two pints shot up the walls and the rest hit the ceiling.\u00a0 Oh yes, none of that namby-pamby ring-pull malarkey in my\u00a0 day\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Anyone who wishes to sign
