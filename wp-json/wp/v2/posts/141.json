baseball on Valium,&#8221; and I have to say I agree with him.\u00a0\u00a0I can safely say I&#8217;ve never ever watched a game from start to finish,\u00a0well I do have a life!\u00a0\u00a0How anyone can get exited over a simple game made to sound so\u00a0complex\u00a0is beyond me.\u00a0\u00a0 May be I&#8217;m an oik, a bit off riff raff if you will, I really don&#8217;t give a monkeys it&#8217;s just so boring.\u00a0 And when\u00a0boredom sets in I can feel my humour tissues priming themselves for a workout.\u00a0 After listening to two of my friends rant on and on about a game between the English and the West Indians, which we always seem to lose,\u00a0I devised a whole new breakdown of the pompous game called cricket just to wind them up, so here it is folks, Walton&#8217;s almanac of Sticks and Twigs.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with the name of the sport, aah haa haa haa harrrrrrrrrr sport &#8211; that&#8217;s priceless.\u00a0 I know what a football is but what is a rugby and\u00a0with that in mind what the hell&#8217;s a cricket?\u00a0 Tis neither bat nor ball nor stump is it?\u00a0\u00a0Back in the day there was little or no equipment and\u00a0lathes hadn&#8217;t been invented so the man of sport was really up against it.\u00a0 In 1346\u00a0 a committee member\u00a0of the MCC\u00a0made plans to employ what fell from the Oak and Ash\u00a0and the humble Box wood and it was then that the name, Stick and Twigs were first used.\u00a0\u00a0Three sticks were stuck in the ground and then two sets of twigs were laid across them.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Now, during the global warming of the day the Woodford county side, The old\u00a0Fartonians noticed when the weather change (got bloody windy) both sets of twigs blew off the sticks, something had to be done.\u00a0 A female street urchin said, &#8220;Use straw\u00a0bound with string.&#8221;\u00a0\u00a0This was a rubbish idea as string hadn&#8217;t been invented.\u00a0 The urchin spoke again, &#8220;Use a bail of hay.&#8221;\u00a0 &#8220;Don&#8217;t be a twatbag,&#8221; the captain said and threw his ball at her knocking the young lady to the ground.\u00a0 In\u00a0years to come\u00a0this would\u00a0be known as, bowling a maiden over.\u00a0 Interestingly the word &#8216;bail&#8217; has survived until this very day.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My that is interesting!<\/p>\n<p>Eventually the problem was solved by using Ebony which was imported from Leytonstone and these bails are still known as the &#8216;heavy set.&#8217;\u00a0 They are a permanent fixture in &#8216;blowy&#8217; games today and in &#8216;non blowy&#8217; games the captain of the home team can ask for\u00a0the &#8216;light set&#8217; if he so wishes &#8211; how exciting!\u00a0 Like the game this decision can take days.\u00a0 The lighter set of bails today\u00a0are all made from the discarded remnants from the Keil Craft range, 1956 to 1973.\u00a0 These have been collected over the years\u00a0from projects that were smashed up out of sheer frustration when son and father alike couldn&#8217;t get their model plane to fly.\u00a0\u00a0Aaah yes\u00a0I well remember the great balsa wood mountain of 1968.<\/p>\n<p>Lunch I think
