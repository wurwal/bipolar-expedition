he remarked, I&#8217;ve phoned the council to see if they can get a man on it.\u00a0 And as luck would have it, they could,\u00a0so 10 months later our resident &#8216;tree doctor&#8217; rushed to the scene of the blockage.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, it was 23 minutes past the hour of seven a.m. precisely, when soppy bollocks turned up!\u00a0 I knew it was this time, because I was just about to go to bed!!! \u00a0(I have a broken sleep pattern)\u00a0 Anyway, despite the repetitive sounds of a chain saw starting up and cut, cut, cutting everything in its path, I did nod off.<\/p>\n<p>When I\u00a0came too, but not\u00a0it three, all was blissfully quiet, and I&#8217;d completely forgotten that the manic tree-slasher of old north London had been to call.\u00a0 However, after a single glance out of the kitchen, from my first floor flat, I couldn&#8217;t help but notice that something was definitely missing.<\/p>\n<p>When I &#8216;hit the pit&#8217; there were a dozen\u00a0beautiful swaying fir trees, green as green could be.\u00a0 True they did block the light in two of my rooms, but all the same, they were a gorgeous and hypnotic sight on a windy day.<\/p>\n<p>I looked again, at what was left of the first of the firs\u00a0to the far left of the line, and it really was quite an exceptional piece of work I have to say.\u00a0 It\u00a0as if a recently sectioned patient had been\u00a0given a free pass for the day, unsupervised, and had been left in charge of the job using a Black &amp; Decker &#8216;Bastard saw&#8217;!\u00a0 I kid you not,\u00a0my Nan could have\u00a0done a better job, and she died last year of &#8216;Raving root rot&#8217;!<\/p>\n<p>In my naivety, I presumed that these beautiful garden privacy features would receive a thorough short back and sides, from top to bottom, by a skilled woodsman.\u00a0 How wrong can you be?\u00a0 This bloke was either in a rush or he wasn&#8217;t being paid enough.<\/p>\n<p>Shaping the trees, it seems, was completely out of the question.\u00a0 And from what I could work out, he&#8217;d taken his tool of choice, and starting\u00a0from roughly 20 feet down from the top, had run the chain saw back to the trunk, and carried on cutting right down to the base of the tree.\u00a0 So, this left tree No. 1, very, very green at the\u00a0top, bald as a badger to the ground, and a nasty shade of brown to boot.<\/p>\n<p>Now, on one tree, the furthest away from my flat, it didn&#8217;t look too shabby, and little rays of daylight had begun to infiltrate my\u00a0lounge.\u00a0 Fairly happy with this outcome, I left the building and headed of to the market of great \u00a0superness, returning sometime later.<\/p>\n<p>While emptying the contents of my shopping bags, it was clear that &#8216;Psycho Sid&#8217; had returned while I was out.\u00a0 There was so much daylight streaming through my windows now; I had to put on\u00a0my Bipolaroids on!<\/p>\n<p>And what was left of the lush wall of evergreens?\u00a0 Just a nasty brown mutilated mess really, with what looked like Christmas tree glued to the tops.\u00a0 The squirrel&#8217;s union were up in paws about it, and they&#8217;d left placards on the remaining four trees which read, &#8220;HELL NO &#8211; WE WON&#8217;T GO!&#8221;\u00a0 There was a strike an&#8217; everything, and we were knee-deep in nuts for weeks!<\/p>\n<p>A month later there was this noise.\u00a0 A noise that my subconscious wouldn&#8217;t allow me to wake up from, until it was too late to hurl abuse out of the window.\u00a0 A couple of hours must have passed by and I got up in my usual daze.\u00a0 I\u00a0sparked up the kettle, looked out of window, lit the first cigarette of the day and drifted off to the bathroom for a pie and mash (slang: slash)<\/p>\n<p>Well, it took a double take, and the time\u00a0it takes to make a cup of tea, followed by smoking the rest of my cigarette, letting the cats out of the window to sniff the morning air, and\u00a0having a casual lean on the draining board, before I realised that the &#8216;tree butcher&#8217; had most definitely called again.<\/p>\n<p>I believe I said out loud, &#8220;FER&#8230; FUCK&#8217;S SAKE!!!&#8221;\u00a0 How could it be worse, you might asked yourself?\u00a0 Well, you remember the top twenty feet that were left untouched by human hand or saw?\u00a0 Well, the son-of-a-bitch had sneaked back and chopped the lot off!\u00a0 I&#8217;ve got so much extra UV light in my flat now, that\u00a0I can get a sun tan when I&#8217;m in bed!<\/p>\n<p>Name check:\u00a0 Donald Findlater!\u00a0 (Interview on BBC24)\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Bloody lucky his parents didn&#8217;t choose William as a first name!<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('\/outgoing\/delicious.com\/post?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbipolar-expedition.local%2Fa-fir-king-nightmare%2F&amp;title=A+Fir+king+nightmare%E2%80%A6');\"  rel='nofollow'  target='_blank'  title='Bookmark this post : A Fir king nightmare&#8230;
