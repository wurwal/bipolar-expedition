shred it"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>So, you&#8217;ve had a nice long holiday, and what do come home to &#8211; a few bills, but at least 15 pieces of junk mail.\u00a0 It\u2019s only paper, but why is it so annoying?\u00a0 For me it\u2019s quite plain and simple, it\u2019s a waste of a perfectly good tree\u2026\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>But, my other gripe with the stuff is that it doesn&#8217;t stop coming through the hole in my door. \u00a0I mean, like you, I know where the fast food outlets are, and if I want a \u2018heart attack in a box\u2019 I\u2019ll go an order one.\u00a0 I don\u2019t need a reminder to tell me when I\u2019m hungry.\u00a0 You know, I might just print up some of my own fliers saying, \u2018No take-aways today, I&#8217;ve\u00a0eaten\u2019, and stick \u2018em through their letterboxes on a regular basis\u00a0and see how they like it!<\/p>\n<p>The best place to live and avoid this papyrus plague is the Fair Isles.\u00a0 Lying half-way between the Orkney Isles and Shetland, it\u2019s the remotest part of the UK, and there isn&#8217;tone single take-away on the island!\u00a0 I&#8217;ll say this for everyone, &#8220;Up yours McDonalds!&#8221;\u00a0 But do know what, junk mail still makes its way to the 70 or so occupants.\u00a0 A boat delivers supplies and post there once a week.\u00a0 The junk mail goes into the bin, the rubbish is collected and then it goes back on the boat and is dropped off at Shetland to be burnt &#8211; and who foots the bill &#8211; the tax payer.\u00a0 I guess the burning question is, why would someone send a Freeman\u2019s catalogue there anyway?<\/p>\n<p>In Cornwall they have a slightly bigger problem.\u00a0 If you lived there you could receive up to 20 or 30 pieces of unwanted\u00a0tat a month.\u00a0 You only have to multiply that amount by the number of residence, and by the end of the year, you&#8217;ve got a paper mountain to dispose of.\u00a0 Oh yes you can recycle it of course, but as usual it comes at price to guess who?\u00a0 Last year, Cornwall accumulated 4,000 tons of little bits of annoyance, enough to fill 500 dust carts.\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s stick it in a landfill site!\u201d\u00a0 \u201cCertainly sir, that\u2019ll be \u00a3700,000 please.\u201d\u00a0 &#8216;OW MUCH?\u00a0 I swear you could build a mental health unit with that!<\/p>\n<p>As usual, there are two sides to any story, and here are the two teams, the trusty Royal Mail and their revenue and a Netherlands based company situated in an anonymous industrial estate\u00a0in London\u00a0called, Spring Global Mail (SGM) and their income.\u00a0 They have a \u2018same dog more hair\u2019 policy regarding junk mail, they call it Direct Mail.\u00a0 Basically, the two companies make money for each other, lots of it, but the set up also leaves a loop hole for the\u00a0scam mail artists to ply their cruel trade.<\/p>\n<p>Now this stuff is nasty.\u00a0 It prays on the vulnerable, the gullible and the mentally ill, but do the two sides feel as if they\u2019re causing a problem?\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to say, as neither company would be interviewed on television.\u00a0 Oh they released a statement slapping each others backs, and mentioned that their services were vital to the economy, but said\u00a0nothing about the harm that scammers cause.<\/p>\n<p>Even though it has a Royal Mail stamp on the envelope, it doesn&#8217;t mean\u00a0it\u2019s been sent from this country!\u00a0 Some how, foreign criminal gangs are allowed to make their post look \u2018local friendly\u2019!\u00a0 They slap a &#8216;Royal Mail&#8217; stamp on it, aim it towards companies like SGM, in bulk, and they pass it on to our \u2018Penny black\u2019 company.\u00a0 Once it\u2019s in the \u2018system\u2019, it has to be delivered.\u00a0 As it\u2019s such a trusted brand many people place their trust in it.\u00a0 Well, after all, the Queen does deliver it herself, although quite how she finds the time at her age baffles me!<\/p>\n<p>So this is how it begins.\u00a0 A vulnerable or elderly person replies to one scam letter that claims they have won say \u00a3250,000.\u00a0 Now the scammers have an address, this is added to what\u2019s known as a \u2018sucker\u2019s list\u2019 and the list is then sold on to other criminal gangs.\u00a0 To win this enormous amount, all you have to do is send \u00a320 to \u2018Scammers r us\u2019 &#8211; and you\u2019re quids in!\u00a0 No you\u2019re not, the prize never arrives, but what does turn up is another letter from a different gang.\u00a0 And that\u2019s all it takes for some people to become addicted.<\/p>\n<p>In one case a guy\u2019s marriage nearly ended after he spent \u00a35,000 hoping to fund a golden wedding anniversary trip.\u00a0 In similar situation another guy\u2019s mother spent a quarter of a million pounds, over a 10 to 12 year period!\u00a0 But the worst case I&#8217;ve heard of was that of an Alzheimer&#8217;s patient.<\/p>\n<p>She\u00a0was convinced\u00a0she would win a huge prize eventually, and her daughter couldn&#8217;t stop her replying to these letters. \u00a0In total, her mum had parted with \u00a350,000, and the last thing she said to her daughter, before she died was, \u201cHas the postman been?\u201d \u00a0When it came to selling her mum\u2019s house her daughter found over 30,000 letters scattered around the property.<\/p>\n<p>Royal Mail said that, in conjunction with the police last year, they removed 6 million scam letters which sounds great, until you hear that foreign con artists flooded the UK with 2.4 billion of the little blighters!\u00a0 SGM were less than helpful.\u00a0 They said that it\u2019s very difficult to remove such post, as you can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s a piece of scam mail, even through transparent wrapping!\u00a0\u00a0 Honestly, have you ever heard such a\u00a0crock of horseshit!!!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>My view &#8211; let&#8217;s hope that one day all of the naughty fake mail bastards die the death of a million paper cuts\u00a0or their combined genitalia turns square and festers at the corners\u00a0real soon&#8230;<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('\/outgoing\/delicious.com\/post?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbipolar-expedition.local%2Fdont-open-it-shred-it%2F&amp;title=Don%E2%80%99t+open+it+%E2%80%93+shred+it');\"  rel='nofollow'  target='_blank'  title='Bookmark this post : Don&#8217;t open it &#8211;
