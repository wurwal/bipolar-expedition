(This is the only way I can describe the \u2018vague feeling of being unwell,\u2019 printed on the paperwork in most anti-depressant packets.)\u00a0 This can just as easily fuck up your life in the same way that a nervous breakdown does.<\/p>\n<p>I was showing signs of cracking under pressure at work.\u00a0 I was losing the ability to concentrate and I felt tired all of the time.\u00a0 My confidence was fast diminishing also.\u00a0 The timing couldn&#8217;t have been worse for me.\u00a0 Five months into the job I was asked if I would go on a shift rota. \u00a0I was in a tenuous position financially and felt obliged to agree to my line manager\u2019s demands.\u00a0 I was still biting the bullet regarding spilling the beans about my first nervous break-down.<\/p>\n<p>The shift required was a week of lates and a week of early\u2019s. \u00a0Things were okay to begin with, but after a few months I found it harder and harder to cope.\u00a0 Until one night I sat in front of a job, when everybody had gone home, for three hours not knowing where to start.\u00a0 My work chum wasn\u2019t best pleased the next day.<\/p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t just angry, he was seething. I tried frantically to explain, but he had an answer for everything and I didn\u2019t.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure you can imagine the atmosphere in the minuscule room.\u00a0 I could feel waves of hate washing over me for most of the morning.\u00a0 After that one incident I was scared stiff of making any other mistakes.\u00a0 My work partner seemed fine as long as everything went his way.\u00a0 I suppose there is something to be said for nepotism.\u00a0 All the same I had never encountered such hostility over a poxy four colour job before.<\/p>\n<p>It hadn\u2019t occurred to me that a different shift would affect my mental state.\u00a0 I had worked on day shifts for over seventeen years up until that point.\u00a0 But the change in working nights affected my sleep pattern from week to week, which in turn affected my eating cycle.\u00a0 Consequently I drifted into a series of high and low episodes.\u00a0 Eventually after being a pain in the arse for months, I came down to earth with an almighty bang.<\/p>\n<p>My boss gave me a month off to sort myself out, but I was too far gone by then.\u00a0 In the end I asked to be made redundant.\u00a0 The highs only got higher after that; I called this period, the \u2018walking on water\u2019 stage.\u00a0 At some point during my well months, I stupidly reduced my medication, over a three-month period, without my doctors\u2019 knowledge.\u00a0 Don\u2019t even contemplate trying this.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Prior to all of my stays in hospital there was always an abundance of incidences leading up to admission. \u00a0This was largely due to the Mental Health Act of 1983, which roughly states, that unless a person is a danger to themselves or others, they can\u2019t be picked up by the old bill and carted off to the nearest fun factory.\u00a0 On this spree of events Mum, Bill and Seron helped to fill in the blank spaces of my second admission into Claybury Hospital.<\/p>\n<p>Mum was coming over to see me knowing I wasn\u2019t quite the whole nine yards again.\u00a0 My sleep pattern was all over the shop, and I had stopped eating.\u00a0 On this particular Saturday morning, I had phoned Bill begging him and his wife, Seron to come down to my flat.<\/p>\n<p>The night before, I had painstakingly re-assembled my drum kit in my front room.\u00a0 For some reason I had decided to do this in the pitch dark at about 3.00 a.m., don\u2019t ask why, I haven\u2019t a clue. \u00a0I was doing everything in slow motion at that point; I believed my patience was being tested in some way.<\/p>\n<p>Normally it would take me forty minutes or so to put my kit together, but on this occasion the conditions were far from normal.\u00a0 I had it in my head that my flat was bugged.\u00a0 To add to my dilemma, I had to take each piece of equipment from a back bedroom, up the creaking hallway and into the front-room.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Rhyme, reason and time-scale had abandoned me yet again, save the odd glance at the clock.\u00a0 It took me over two and a half hours to put up my drum kit, which I managed to do in near silence.\u00a0 Bill and Seron arrived about mid-day.\u00a0 They were visibly taken aback by the sight that had met their eyes.\u00a0 They were equally surprised to see that I had taken the mattresses off the bunk beds and was now using them as sound-proofing.<\/p>\n<p>Bill and I had played together in a band for a number of years.\u00a0 He was the guitarist.\u00a0 One of our high-points was a Radio 1 session on the Janice Long show. \u00a0The creative buzz that I had all those years ago had returned and, three months prior to this, I had blown the dust off my sticks and begun to practise again.\u00a0 Of all the music I listened to, one song held my attention, \u2018Seven Days\u2019, by Sting.\u00a0 It\u2019s a peach of a track in 7\/8 time, and after weeks of warming up to 4\/4 music it became the only song I would play.<\/p>\n<p>Initially I sat for hours listening to the track as a whole, and then gradually broke the drum-patterns down into sections.\u00a0 Once I had the bass and snare firmly fixed in my mind, I concentrated on the cymbal pushes and finally I worked on all of the drum-fills.\u00a0 The only part I couldn\u2019t perfect was a short section just before the song fades out; the drummer does too many fills for my little head to remember.\u00a0 Now all I wanted to do was play it at the proper volume and see if I could still hack it as a drummer.<\/p>\n<p>Bill and Seron sat and listened dutifully as I cranked up the stereo and put the tape on.\u00a0 I played the song once, and once only, using my speakers as a make-shift fold back system.\u00a0 One to the left of me standing on a stool and the other, to my right, angled up at forty-five degrees at the base of my Hi- hat stand.\u00a0 When the track finished I said out loud, \u201cStill got it.\u201d\u00a0 That single performance was all the gratification I needed or expected.\u00a0 The next couple of hours were spent rifling through my record and tape collection reminiscing.<\/p>\n<p>At 2.00 p.m. Mum arrived to find Bill, Seron and myself knee-deep in vinyl, cassettes and album covers.\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s all this then?\u201d\u00a0 She asked.\u00a0 Seron assured her that there had only been one floor-show that afternoon.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cJust as well really,\u201d she replied starring at me in disbelief.\u00a0 \u201cWhat must have the neighbours thought?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cSod the neighbours,\u201d I said. \u00a0Unfortunately my words opened up Mum\u2019s entire book of stock phrases, volume one. \u00a0Starting with, \u201cWell that\u2019s all right for you to say,\u201d and ending with, \u201cAnd another thing, did you think about that?\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>By the time she had gone through her entire repertoire, I had made a sandwich, eaten it and poured her out a cup of coffee.\u00a0 This was the only way to stop her drifting into her second volume of nagging for the Home Counties North, advanced level.<\/p>\n<p>Part three next week&#8230;<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a
