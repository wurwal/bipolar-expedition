they haven\u2019t got a clue about real life or people, and they couldn\u2019t knock the top off a rice pudding unless they were armed with a 12 bore! \u00a0I\u2019m taking, of course, about the great British landed gentry and their urge to hunt and kill small animals.\u00a0 Pick something tiny and insignificant and soon their will be a party of \u2018fan-nar fan-nars\u2019 (upper class twits), chasing it with a gun &#8211; but immaculately dressed. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>All I can do is draw from two important life-lessons instilled in me by my parents, from a very early age.\u00a0 \u201cLearn to lose gracefully and pride yourself in a sense of fair play in all circumstances.\u201d\u00a0 Boys and girls, I give you, the foxhunting debate.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Now, according to the upper crust, you and I are classed as bits of rough and\u00a0dwell in riff-raff circles.\u00a0 Do I give a rat arse, not really; at least I know I\u2019m a decent bloke who would help anyone. \u00a0And I\u2019d rather be me than think like this&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI have an enormous amount of wherewithal, I\u2019m immensely well educated and I can do what I want when I want, because I have friends in high places.\u00a0 And anyone\u00a0below these criteria is cannon fodder.\u201d\u00a0 Yip, that\u2019s how the higher echelons of the \u2018Berk\u2019 squad <em>(Berk: cockney rhyming ~ Berkshire hunt)<\/em> think, and what they pass on to their children.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Obviously I\u2019ve looked at the hunting argument from all sides, not just both sides, because that\u2019s what I do.\u00a0 But, I still find it hard to believe that it\u2019s classed as one, a sport or two, that it\u2019s fair.\u00a0 On team one you have a very naughty fox, and on the other you could have as many as 200 riders, plus some unpaid staff (riff-raff) and 60 to 80 hounds.\u00a0 Now, even as a failed math\u2019s thicky, I can see an imbalance in numbers pretty much straight away!\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The argument for ripping foxes apart is: they kill farmer\u2019s animals.\u00a0 Well all right, let the famer shot them.\u00a0 It would be a tad more humane than letting a bunch of unfed dogs set about the animal.\u00a0 Oh no, that would put a halt to the \u2018gathering\u2019 wouldn\u2019t it!\u00a0 Alright then, let\u2019s all meet up at the Twatley-Smyth\u2019s hiyse (house) once a week\u00a0for a game of \u2018Maim the beater\u2019!<\/p>\n<p>And as for bring up children to hunt in the same way well, there\u2019s a life\u2019s work for a psychiatrists right there.\u00a0 \u201cCome on Jocasta, we\u2019re going to kill something minuscule and mange-ridden.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cHoorah, but is it hygienic to daub the blood of my first kill around my chops when it\u2019s still warm mater?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cOh yes dear, everyone does it, and it didn\u2019t affect me at all, whinny-whinny-snort-snort!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So, this is largely how the people\u2019s food chain works from the top of the hunt downwards. \u00a0Your entire bloodline, past and present, were or are Conservatives. \u00a0You will have lived on the family estate and have an enormous amount of \u2018folding\u2019 money, none of which you earned. \u00a0You are such a Royalist that you fully believe that that\u2019s where your roots lie, and the police wouldn\u2019t dare try to prosecute you because you\u2019re loaded and always tell the truth!<\/p>\n<p>Now, the only issue these pillocks have to worry about is how they can keep up there lifestyle without actually getting their hands dirty.\u00a0 And the first \u2018wheeze\u2019 they thought of was to slap a farm on their vast amount of land.\u00a0 They could pump up their already inflated ego by employing a \u2018gaggle\u2019 of plebs to run it, and at the end of the year cop most of the cash from the harvest.\u00a0 And not only that, they could charge the riff-raff rent for the privilege of living on their land and order them about as\u00a0they work their nuts off for 22 hours a day.\u00a0 Brilliant!\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Well it\u2019s okay for a while, but then the toffs get bored.\u00a0 What to do &#8211; put your name down on the list of hunting venues, get a bit life in the old place what.\u00a0 The master of the hunt and a few friends get a free ride but, everyone below that is charged a fee.\u00a0 What makes me laugh is, even within the snobbery, there\u2019s a hierarchical pecking order &#8211; priceless!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Any mounted riders are <strong>required <\/strong>(told) to stay at the <strong>rear<\/strong>of the field master, and you will be hung, drawn and quartered, and then tortured, if you overtake him.\u00a0 And the charge for this honoured position is between \u00a325 and \u00a370.\u00a0 Those following on foot or by car (sad gits) are informed not to get in the way of the fox, and are charged a \u2018cap\u2019 of a\u00a0\u00a31 or \u00a32, towards the cost of the hunt.\u00a0 Multiply some of these figures by 200 and you\u2019ve got a nice little earner.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s been going on for centuries, since the earliest recorded foxhunt in 1534, in Norfork, England.\u00a0 So the toffs have had a good run, until animal rights activist kicked up a stink and wanted the Government to ban it.\u00a0 It was voted on under a Labour administration, when Tony Blair was in charge, and oh my, the Conservatives weren\u2019t a happy bunch of bunnies when the vote went 362 to 154 in favour of an out right ban.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Not content with hunting the adult foxes, these bastards hunt\/hunted the cubs too, and what goes generally unreported is that the dogs stray on to country roads and are hit and killed by cars or gain appealing injuries when they become entangled in barbed wire fences.\u00a0 In one case 11 dogs were killed at once, when they were hit by a train!<\/p>\n<p>Safe to say, it\u2019s still one rule for \u2018us\u2019 and another for \u2018them\u2019 in dear old Blighty. \u00a0If I cantered down the middle of the road, and held up the traffic because a pack of my dogs had spilled onto it, I\u2019d get arrested!\u00a0 However, don a bright red jacket, wave your hand about like a prat while carrying a brass instrument, and\u00a0your unbiased\u00a0Conservative-voting constabulary let you get on with it!<\/p>\n<p>Right, I&#8217;m off.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve got a frog baiting contest to referee&#8230;<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('\/outgoing\/delicious.com\/post?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbipolar-expedition.local%2Ftantivy-yoiks-away-ya-berks%2F&amp;title=Tantivy+and+yoiks+away+%E2%80%93+ya+berks%E2%80%A6');\"  rel='nofollow'  target='_blank'  title='Bookmark this post : Tantivy &#038;
