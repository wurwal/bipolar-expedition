And for the record, here&#8217;s my lastest author marlarkey: <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('\/outgoing\/www.ex-l-ence.com\/Neil-Walton.php');\"  href=\"http:\/\/www.ex-l-ence.com\/Neil-Walton.php\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.ex-l-ence.com\/Neil-Walton.php <\/a>To give you a feel of the new book, here&#8217;s a Bank Holiday story called &#8211; Towel please<\/p>\n<p>So I went to bloody Windsor Safari Park, I didn\u2019t want to go &#8211; but I did. \u00a0I knew it would be a day of traffic jams, noise and a car load of kids, some of whom weren\u2019t mine, moaning and asking the question that all children are programmed to ask during an outing, \u201cAre we there yet?\u201d\u00a0 I\u2019m talking of course about the great British bank holiday when there are only two divisions in the weather, you either face a three hour drive in monsoon conditions from the minute you hit the road or the temperature is akin to that of Death Valley.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a working dad\u2019s nightmare; ahead of you is a long weekend.\u00a0 You might\u2019ve had thoughts above your station, like doing a 100 percent of knob-all squared for a change, but then your little preying mantis, who\u2019s been in lengthy talks with another little praying mantis, comes up with the suggestion of a joint assault on a theme park, dragging you and the dustbin lids with them to spend money you haven\u2019t got!\u00a0 But hey, you have to do the dad thing don\u2019t you, and I have to say it was great to see the kids with a smile on their faces that lasted all day.\u00a0 Yes there were kids, noise, shit and confusion everywhere, and you could see the, \u201cI told you so,\u201d look on every father\u2019s face in the park but only a fool would\u2019ve said it out loud.<\/p>\n<p>Our day began by watching the lions having a siesta; well, it was 94 in the shade and 115 in the car, but oh boy did the primates make up for the lack of movement in the big cat\u2019s enclosure.\u00a0 If they weren\u2019t crapping on the bonnet or attempting to pull each others foreskins over their heads they were ripping off aerials, wiper blades and wing mirrors in a well organised military manoeuvre. \u00a0When the tour ended we found ourselves in a car park the size of the Wembley, and in this vast expanse of land was the smallest refreshment area in Europe.\u00a0 After the sweltering conditions of the car, grown adults were throwing children and the disabled out of the way to get an iced drink, and it didn\u2019t matter if it was Bat flavoured!\u00a0 Once re-hydrated, a smart arse in our party produced a bunch of tickets for an aquarium show.\u00a0 After the heat of the day it turned out to be the best place to be.\u00a0 Well, it was until the sun changed position.<\/p>\n<p>The sea lions did their stuff first and then it was the turn of the dolphins, and they were good too, the kids loved it.\u00a0 As a final farewell the trainer gave them their last command before they made their way back to a holding pen.\u00a0 How we chuckled when we saw a gaggle of fish weighing 70lbs a piece hurtling towards the edge of the pool like a bunch of smiling torpedoes.\u00a0 And we laughed out loud when they landed on their backs and drenched 30 people ringside, mainly because we were sitting 12 rows from the front and still basking in brilliant sunshine.\u00a0 However, this was definitely the wrong time to start getting drenched in H2O.\u00a0 The sun was beginning to disappear behind an arched structure in the aquarium but there was still one more act to go in the programme and, just after 5.00pm, \u2018it\u2019 (singular but large) entered the pool.<\/p>\n<p>The trainer introduced Shamo the killer whale to the crowd and the first thing that crossed my mind was, \u201cI\u2019m really glad I\u2019m not sitting down the front.\u201d\u00a0 This bugger had to weigh three and half tons if he was an ounce and from where we were seated I could see that we may be in line for a soaking if he was ordered to jump. \u00a0Oh he was smart all right, but ultimately he was just a 25 foot splashing machine.<\/p>\n<p>Being an \u2018upstairs for thinking and a downstairs for ballet\u2019 kind of a guy, I grabbed the Prato-matic from my wife\u2019s bag on the pretence that I was off to take some pictures of the blubbery bugger<strong> <\/strong>in close up and parked myself on the nearest staircase.\u00a0 Like a fool she fell for it, boo-wa-ha-ha!\u00a0 I was off mate, because I wasn\u2019t going to get wet for anyone. \u00a0If the small fry could take out the front row, this puppy would have no trouble coating an entire section of seats from top to bottom in one hit.<\/p>\n<p>So the show began and opened with a few basic tricks and, after one circuit of the pool, the whale beached itself on the trainer\u2019s platform and waited for its teeth to be cleaned.\u00a0 This was followed by a counting exercise, and then the trainer stuck his head in the whale\u2019s mouth.\u00a0 Trusting brave or stupid? \u00a0I\u2019m still not sure, but I guess the only question you really have to ask yourself is, would you stick your head in something that\u2019s name was prefixed with the word, \u2018killer\u2019?<\/p>\n<p>Anyway the sunlight had all but disappeared from the aquarium now, and what was a cooling summer zephyr had turned into an icy draft, more so (tee hee) for the people sitting in wet clothes.\u00a0 Now it may\u2019ve been just a coincidence but, to me, it seemed that all of Shamo\u2019s tricks with the splashiest outcome were left to the end of the show, and everything after the ride round the pool with the trainer on its back had been specifically designed to soak as many people in the audience as possible.<\/p>\n<p>We watched a few ball and hoop tricks first, where a fair proportion of the crowd received a generous coating from one end of the pool to the other, some twice, and then we witnessed the fish in the gob routine up a ladder.\u00a0 The trainer &#8211; not the whale! \u00a0How we clapped with glee as he fell backwards into the water and soaked the front row for a third time, the whale &#8211; not the trainer!\u00a0 As this trick was staged at the far side of the pool, it didn\u2019t pose a threat to me, but it didn\u2019t take long to work out a probable damage report if the beast was instructed to jump closer to my side of the pool.\u00a0 There were only two parts to the equation, a 7,840lb fish that would do literally anything for a kipper, and 4,000,000 gallons of cold water.\u00a0 Result &#8211; a small tsunami.<\/p>\n<p>I waved to my wife to validate my position, and my time away from the main herd pretending to take pictures of the whale\u2019s finale.\u00a0 The trainer blew his whistle four times and Shamo began to circle the pool like a thing possessed.<\/p>\n<p>Have you ever had a strong gut feeling about something but then you ignored it? \u00a0If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that I was still bone dry I might\u2019ve returned to my seat.\u00a0 As it was, I stuck to my guns but moved up half dozen steps to improve my chances of staying that way.<\/p>\n<p>The arse with the whistle blew it once more and lumpy, the seal murderer leapt out of the water and cleared the surface by 30 feet easily.\u00a0 Then he turned in mid air and landed on his back; his tail being the last thing to disappear from view.\u00a0 Then some of the displacement from the pool went left to right, but the bulk of splash, caused by its tail, sent a wall of well-targeted water in my direction.\u00a0 I sat there dripping like a wet lettuce in my shorts amid a chorus of laughter and applause.<\/p>\n<p>Have you ever smiled outwardly but through gritted teeth said quietly, \u201cSon-of-a-bitch?\u201d \u00a0Thinking my embarrassment would soon end I wiped my face down and waited for the 100 or so faces to turn their attention to something else but oh no, there was more to come.<\/p>\n<p>Still coming to terms with the shock of being drenched, head to foot, in cold water I realised I\u2019d neglected one simple fact &#8211; the old what goes up malarkey. \u00a0And the first sign of this presented itself in the form of a cold trickling sensation at the back of my shorts, which immediately prompted this question from one of my warmer brain cells, shortly after my testicles had made a bid to re-enter my body.\u00a0 Where would the residue of a jet of water that was a 100 feet high and four feet wide go after coming back down to terra firma?\u00a0 Back down the bloody staircase I was parked on of course!\u00a0 The trickle gained in volume and I was now sitting in the path of a torrent of much colder water which was now crashing against my back, and cascading over my head, as it made its way back down to the pool.<\/p>\n<p>As an unpaid sideshow member, the laughter and applause were wearing thin. \u00a0Outwardly I smiled, but inwardly I was cursing the oversized kipper-catcher, and began making plans to add a large quantity of strychnine to his feed bucket before we left, in a bid to reduce him to cat food.\u00a0 And let\u2019s not forget the happy-go-lucky trainer that was dishing out the commands.\u00a0 Sadly, there wasn\u2019t time to organise, operation \u2018string up the bastard with the whistle,\u2019 still, not to worry, I\u2019ll get \u2018im next time once the restraining order has been lifted!<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a
