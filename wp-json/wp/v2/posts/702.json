bollards to you madam!"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Well it&#8217;s a bit like camping.\u00a0 Seven days of it and you can&#8217;t wait to get home to a comfortable bed&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m talking, of course, about hiring a boat and\u00a0setting sail\u00a0on the river Thames.\u00a0 It did seem like a great idea at the time, but come the middle of the week I&#8217;d had enough.\u00a0 I&#8217;m not sure what tipped the balance in my mind, the boredom of travelling at speeds that a snail would laugh at\u00a0or the fact that I fell in at a mooring site, just before a lock, which left me with half a pound of small stones embedded in my heel.\u00a0 Looking back now, as a 23 year old,\u00a0it was\u00a0the whole cycle of the trip wore me down in the end.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Overall, it seems all to easy to hire a boat\u00a0and set off down or up the river, depending where you start.\u00a0 All I\u00a0can recall was a little chubster of a\u00a0marine owner saying, &#8220;Thanks for the cash, here&#8217;s the key, there&#8217;s your boat and see you in a week!&#8221;\u00a0 The rest was up to us!\u00a0 So, after stowing our belongings away and sparking up the engine of HMS\u00a0Intrepid, the four of us headed off in search of\u00a0the nearest pub.<\/p>\n<p>However, before you make to the nearest inn, like life, there are a certain amount of\u00a0 obstacles, barriers if you will, that are set to fuck up your transit towards a clutch of\u00a0decent\u00a0pints of bitter.\u00a0 Opening you first lock is a fascinating exercise.\u00a0 You don&#8217;t know what to do, but people appear out of nowhere to help.\u00a0 But, by lock 315, you really don&#8217;t give a shit, especially after you&#8217;ve worked out that if you had a straight run, with no locks, you could add\u00a0another two days to your holiday.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Were we warned about accidents that may occur on our journey?\u00a0 &#8220;Key, boat, see you next week.&#8221;\u00a0 If we were I&#8217;d missed it!\u00a0 At one point my girlfriend took the wheel and all was fine for quite some time.\u00a0 That was until we entered a private yachting marina.\u00a0 Rather than alert the crew of any impending doom, my lady-love kept schtum, hoping she could sneak out the same way she stumbled into the boating equivalent of\u00a0a Rolls Royce showroom.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>And the plan worked, right up until the point where something long and expensive looking, which was\u00a0sticking out proud of another boat, made contact with the side of our boat.\u00a0 There was this sort of straining\u00a0noise, which was followed by an unnerving scraping sound.\u00a0 I woke up to find part of an aluminium mast making an entrance through a window which then made contact with the frame of the window.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I\u00a0watched as\u00a0out boat lurched forward, instead of the intended direction of reverse, and heard the cries of a young female in distress saying, &#8220;Bollocks, fuck it,&#8221; and, &#8220;bollocks,&#8221; once more!\u00a0 I&#8217;m not quite sure how we slipped away unnoticed, baring in mind the row that\u00a0the collision made, plus the level of human vocal activity, but some how we did.\u00a0 And the damage?\u00a0 Well we couldn&#8217;t shut our window now.\u00a0 And the yacht&#8217;s mast?\u00a0 Personally I thought the bend at the tip of it lent it a certain amount of charm!\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>A few days into our voyage we met up with boaters and punts brigade.\u00a0 It was all very Pimms and jolly nice dresses, if you know what I mean.\u00a0 Bloody idiots &#8211; loads of money, but a sad lack of common sense.\u00a0 Thank God we had missed the Henley Regatta by exactly one week, these prats were just\u00a0the warm-up act.<\/p>\n<p>Did anyone mention anything about the boat&#8217;s engine?\u00a0 &#8220;Key, boat, bye.&#8221;\u00a0 Nope, don&#8217;t think so.\u00a0 On the Thursday there was this smell.\u00a0 A smell which\u00a0smelt like if it could speak wouldv&#8217;e\u00a0said, WARNING &#8211;\u00a0WARNING &#8211;\u00a0WILL ROBINSON\u00a0-YOU&#8217;RE ENGINE IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE.\u00a0\u00a0But it didn&#8217;t.\u00a0 So, after waiting for five hours for it to cool down, we thought we had better put some\u00a0lubricant in the oil-starved engine.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The very next day we managed to beach our trusty puddle steamer on a sandbank.\u00a0 Aah yes,\u00a0the joys of standing at the helm, while sailing into the midday\u00a0sun with a blinding hangover.\u00a0 \u00a0Fortunately the crew of a tourist boat alerted their man at the wheel, and he shouted at us to wait for the backwash of his cruiser while slamming our wreck in reverse.<\/p>\n<p>I think the main reason the trip wore me down to a frazzle were to key points.\u00a0 The first was the chemical toilet.\u00a0 Man, it was toxic in there.\u00a0 And that was before anyone had used it.\u00a0 For tuppence I&#8217;d have had a dump over the side, but you know what it&#8217;s like, you just can&#8217;t go when a bunch of canoeists paddle past or a gaggle of cyclists drift by on the tow path\u00a0can you!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Well, by day six you&#8217;re completely pissed off\u00a0with\u00a0life on a boat.\u00a0 The\u00a0bog stinks to\u00a0high heaven, the fly and mosquito population seems to have tripled, and you&#8217;ve totally run out of patience with anything to do with the lock gates.\u00a0 However, one thing you&#8217;re not going to miss is, parking up at night.\u00a0 You&#8217;re tired, you can&#8217;t be arsed to cook, and all you want to do is hit the nearest pub.\u00a0 But can you find a mooring site?\u00a0 Can you bollocks!\u00a0 You can see plenty of spaces, but can you reach them before a German U Boat slips in before you?\u00a0 NOT AT\u00a08 FUCKING\u00a0MILES PER HOUR YOU CAN&#8217;T!!!!\u00a0\u00a0They already had their towels down at 2:30 in the afternoon!\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>You disembark, making sure you pull up with the damaged window facing away from the landing stage, and say to the boat owner, &#8220;Key, boat, and &#8211;\u00a0by,&#8221;\u00a0then run like hell to your car, hoping the bloke with the aluminium mast hasn&#8217;t rung the guy demanding money with menecies.\u00a0 NO, NO, NO &#8211;\u00a0 NEVER , EVER AGAIN\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>[US News now: there&#8217;s a place in Cincinnati, Ohio
