It was frightening to think that something like that could be erased from my memory.\u00a0 I was glad I wasn&#8217;t the only one feeling like it, something to do with safety in numbers I suppose.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Days after the treatment, I was still having trouble remembering things, but E.C.T. had definitely shifted my morose mood to a euphoric state at the flick of a switch.\u00a0 I had six sessions of E.C.T. followed by what can only be described as intermittent amnesia.\u00a0 I was discharged from Claybury Hospital after one month and was in a better frame of mind, though I was still suffering the side-effects of my medication and the E.C.T. memory block.\u00a0 I will cover the side effects of medication in another chapter.<\/p>\n<p>The side-effects of electro-convulsive therapy are headaches, initially followed by short-term memory loss.\u00a0 In my case, this lasted three months.\u00a0 On the positive side, it shifted my mood in conjunction with anti-depressants.\u00a0 My only concern was that the doctors were unsure of its success in lifting depression.\u00a0 Another possible draw back was that a maximum of sixteen sessions were allowed.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>If it failed to work after sixteen times then another solution would have to be found. Nobody has told me why or what happens if you have more?\u00a0 Interestingly enough when E.C.T. was first used fifty years ago, no anaesthetic was used.\u00a0 This makes me wonder, if it were to be invented today, would the British Medical Counsel allow its use in treating people suffering from clinical depression?\u00a0 There is no evidence of any permanent side effects caused from E.C.T<\/p>\n<p>Updated\u00a0information\u00a0from the Royal College of Psychiatrists website&#8230;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What do those in favour of ECT say?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Many doctors and nurses\u00a0will say that they have seen ECT relieve very severe depressive illnesses when other treatments have failed.\u00a0 Bearing in mind that 15% of people with severe depression will kill themselves, they feel that ECT has saved patients&#8217; lives, and therefore the overall benefits are greater than the risks.\u00a0 Some people who have had ECT will agree and may even ask for it if they find themselves becoming depressed again.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What do those against ECT say?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>There are many different views and many different reasons why people object to ECT.\u00a0 Some say that ECT is an inhumane and degrading treatment, which belongs to the past.\u00a0 They say that the side-effects are severe and that psychiatrists have either accidentally or deliberately ignored how severe they can be.\u00a0 They say that ECT permanently damages both the brain and the mind, and if it does work at all, does so in a way that is ultimately harmful for the patient.\u00a0 Many would want to see it banned.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m chuffed to say there&#8217;s been a good response to my first chapter, so I shall be adding chapter two as a follow up starting next week&#8230;<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a
