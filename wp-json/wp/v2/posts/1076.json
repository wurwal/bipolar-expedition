There was a benefits office, sub-post office, a church, laundry, path lab and a massive kitchen, a dental surgery, an E.C.T. room, a dispensary and even a hairdresser.<\/p>\n<p>I followed Bill to the reception desk where he asked for directions to ward N2.\u00a0 As we walked down a long gloomy corridor, I felt like a condemned man going to the gallows.\u00a0 There was no turning back now.\u00a0 I was entering this place of my own accord and at some point Bill was going to walk away and leave me there.\u00a0 I wasn&#8217;t looking forward to that all. \u00a0We climbed a flight of stairs to find a large white door with a sign on it saying N2 in a bold typeface.<\/p>\n<p>Bill pressed the doorbell and a few moments later somebody looked through the eyepiece and then unlocked the door.\u00a0 This entrance led us into a large pastel blue painted hallway.\u00a0 There were a few seats lined up against the wall, with a battered looking phone on it. \u00a0When some of the inmates spied two bits of fresh meat walking in, we became an immediate target for requests for cigarettes.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>A small group of patients were talking at the tops of their voices about things that made no sense at all. \u00a0The nurse didn&#8217;t bat an eyelid.\u00a0 Obviously this was the ward norm, or abnormality as the case may be.\u00a0 Was this the real twilight zone?<\/p>\n<p>Bill told the nurse my name and he showed us to a table next to the ward office.\u00a0 \u201cRight,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cYour name is Neil Walton.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cYes,\u201d I replied.\u00a0 He asked for my home address then proceeded to ask me a number of questions relating to how I was feeling at that particular moment in time. I told him, \u201cI felt tired, freezing cold and just a little scared to death.\u201d\u00a0 He asked me if I knew where I was.\u00a0 \u201cYes,\u201d I replied with a lump in my throat. \u201cI\u2019m in Claybury Hospital.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cDo you know why you are here Neil?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m here to get better.\u201d I answered pathetically.\u00a0 He went on, \u201cSome of these questions may seem a little strange but they will help us to determine your mental state at the present time.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cDo you feel like harming yourself or anybody else?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cNo,\u201d I replied.\u00a0 \u201cHave you tried to harm yourself in the past?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cYes.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The next question took me by surprise.\u00a0 The nurse asked me if I had heard voices in my head.\u00a0 I thought about it momentarily, not wishing to give him the impression I had.\u00a0 I then replied as nonchalantly as I could saying, \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I had of course listened to my Dad\u2019s voice, which to me was quite normal, as he had not long passed over.\u00a0 I have had a lot of psychic occurrences in my life that I would still like explained to me.\u00a0 However, this all happened when I was mentally healthy, so I was buggered if I was going tell a complete stranger working in a psychiatric hospital that I had heard voices.\u00a0 I would have never been discharged.\u00a0 I felt as though I had used my last remaining marbles wisely.<\/p>\n<p>I felt my Dad\u2019s presence when I wrote the first draft of these pages.\u00a0 It was 4.00 a.m. and the rain was pouring down the windows.\u00a0 It was still dark, and the ticking clock in my room was the only thing that broke the silence.\u00a0 Sometimes I can feel him with me, which gives me a great sense of well-being and strength.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I thought the signing-in procedure was nearly over and Bill must have had enough of hanging around.\u00a0 We had been in the hospital well over an hour by now.\u00a0 Once the paperwork had been dealt with I was shown to my sleeping quarters.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t impressed with the thought of sharing my bed space in a dormitory with 26 inmates. \u00a0There were clothes strewn over a big radiator and two patients were already asleep.\u00a0 One of them was snoring like a bull elephant.\u00a0 The only privacy you had was a thin cotton curtain that hung between each bed from a rail.<\/p>\n<p>We were shown into the day room.\u00a0 At one end, near a huge bay window, was a table tennis table.\u00a0 In the centre of the room there were thirty armchairs, with some small tables scattered around.\u00a0 Most of them had dirty tin foil ashtrays on them, half of which were filled with hand rolled cigarette butts.\u00a0 We sat down again and I now had to give the nurse a list of my clothing in case anything was stolen during my stay.\u00a0 Bill was ever so patient while this was going on, I was so glad he was with me.<\/p>\n<p>It was a terrible day for me; I couldn&#8217;t have coped without him.\u00a0 Once my clothes had been accounted for the nurse said, \u201cThat\u2019s almost it, you just have to be checked over by a duty doctor.\u201d\u00a0 Bill was about to leave.\u00a0 He gave me a long hug and said, \u201cDon\u2019t forget, Seron and I will be thinking of you and we will come and visit you as soon as we are allowed to.\u201d His final comment was, \u201cTake good care of yourself, love ya,\u201d and with that he left.<\/p>\n<p>I fought hard to stop myself from crying.\u00a0 I heard the heavy door shut behind him, and a few seconds after that the door was locked. I was now friendless and terrified of my first night in a psychiatric hospital and dreading the next full day.<\/p>\n<p>The last hurdle I had to face was the visit from the duty doctor.\u00a0 I sat down smoking cigarette after cigarette. \u00a0Half an hour must have past by when I saw a youngish man walk into the ward office. \u00a0I presumed he was the duty doctor.\u00a0 A few minutes later the nurse introduced him to me and he asked me to follow him into a small side room. \u00a0He took my blood pressure and then checked my breathing.\u00a0 Then he started to prod my liver about, asking me questions as he went about his examination.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDo you smoke?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cYes,\u201d I said.\u00a0 \u201cDrink?\u201d He asked coldly.\u00a0 \u201cYes,\u201d I replied.\u00a0 \u201cTaken drugs?\u201d He inquired harshly.\u00a0 \u201cI smoked cannabis about fifteen years ago if that counts.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cOkay, that\u2019s it,\u201d he said. It was all over in five minutes.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t much care for his bedside manner.\u00a0 I was glad when it was all over.\u00a0 I felt as though I had ruined his evening.\u00a0 By the way he was dressed it looked as if he had to break off a dinner date or a night at the opera.<\/p>\n<p>Part four next week&#8230;<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li
