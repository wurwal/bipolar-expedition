bipolar microwave treatment: Catherine&#8217;s fit for work in 5 days!"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Well&#8230;if\u00a0Nora Clacket from Dunbar had\u00a0checked in to the Silver Hills psychiatric hospital, would anybody have\u00a0given a toss?\u00a0 No, is the simple answer to that.\u00a0 However, if you&#8217;re a newly outed celebrity mental, outed by your publicist that is, man you&#8217;re gonna be popular!\u00a0 I would&#8217;ve loved to have been a fly on the wall during that meeting&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>As a type II sufferer, I am a tad confused by the statement issued by Catherine Zeta Jones&#8217;s spokeswoman, Cece Yorke.\u00a0\u00a0She confirmed that she had received mental health treatment to help her cope with her traumatic personal life. &#8216;After dealing with the stress of the past year, Catherine made the decision to check into a mental health facility for a brief stay to treat her bipolar II disorder,&#8217; she said.\u00a0 She&#8217;s feeling great and looking forward to starting work this week on two upcoming films.&#8217;\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Now, up until that point in the media, no-one knew\u00a0that Zeta-Jones had a bipolar disorder, and hey, why should they, it&#8217;s none of their business.\u00a0 So why\u00a0disclose the\u00a0news now, giving the just\u00a0merest amount of\u00a0facts, and then nothing more\u00a0since the initial statement?\u00a0\u00a0[Methinks someone was about to dish the dirt, and this\u00a0was a PR excercise\u00a0to quell the naughty rumours, while appeasing the film company&#8217;s backers\u00a0that a certain party won&#8217;t be\u00a0taken away\u00a0in a &#8216;happy limo&#8217;, in\u00a0the new\u00a0Gucci &#8216;all-in-one\u00a0jacket&#8217; (straps a permanent feature)\u00a0during takes!\u00a0 Well &#8211; films are awfully expensive to make now-a-days.]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, I\u00a0don&#8217;t have a problem with people who suffer with a mental illness,\u00a0but what I&#8217;m pissed off about, and believe me I am fuming,\u00a0is the way this annoucement has been handled by her publicist.\u00a0 This is how it came across to me sane, sober,\u00a0and as\u00a0&#8216;well&#8217; as\u00a0I can be for the last nine years, after five break-downs.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Everything in Catherine Zeta Jones&#8217;s life was all going swimmingly: films,\u00a0wealth, married into the Douglas family (more chashy-wonga) more films,(even more green-backs)\u00a0had a couple kids, blah, blah, blah\u00a0and blah.\u00a0 And then &#8211; WALLOP &#8211; out of nowhere &#8211; she&#8217;s a\u00a0mental\u00a0 &#8211; and five days later she&#8217;s &#8216;feeling great&#8217;!\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d love to know what form of treatment she had, I could&#8217;ve done with that a few years ago.\u00a0 &#8220;Mr Walton, you have a type II bipolar disorder.\u00a0 Take four years out of your life while we\u00a0find a drug that will give you a therapeutic effect.&#8221;\u00a0 [Doffs cap &#8211; drags carcass out of hospital &#8211;\u00a0loses job, house and marriage.]\u00a0\u00a0 I can only assume that\u00a0Ms Jones must have slept in a new mental health microwave.\u00a0 &#8220;Six minutes on high nurse,\u00a0 Ms Jones your treatment is complete.&#8221;\u00a0 &#8220;There&#8217;s lovely aren&#8217;t I, heres $3,850, oh bollocks, make it four grand.&#8221;\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>From a medical\u00a0prospective and\u00a0my personal experiences\u00a0of the disorder,\u00a0I\u00a0can&#8217;t help\u00a0think that\u00a0Ms Jones&#8217;s publicist has dropped a bollock on this one, because the story doesn&#8217;t add up. \u00a0I listened, completely agog, at\u00a0information\u00a0that all she had suffered with was\u00a012 months of stress\u00a0due to her husband&#8217;s diagnosis of throat cancer, she&#8217;d\u00a0hit the drink and her fag input had reached the chain-smoking level.\u00a0 Clearly there&#8217;s more\u00a0to the story, there has to be.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Will we find out the truth?\u00a0\u00a0Oh yeah, you just wait, it&#8217;ll be a disgruntled former maid, chef or pool girl who blows it wide open, and all because a caring sharing publicist was worried that the stigma of mental ill health would affect her\u00a0clients earning power and reduce her own\u00a0income.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I sincerely wish you well Catherine, and\u00a0don&#8217;t worry, you are in a great circle of decent human beings, and if you ever want a chat, feel free to contact me (yeah, like that&#8217;s going to happen)\u00a0but please, get a new publicist.\u00a0 She has personally insulted\u00a0me, and the rest of the bipolar squad,\u00a0by her lack of knowledge of\u00a0the illness,\u00a0and given the impression that you can treat a type II bipolar disorder in five days&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Ooh look &#8211;\u00a0it&#8217;s the Lithium lady!!!<\/p>\n<div
