out, watch out, there&#8217;s a smoke Nazi about!"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>At the start 2007, here in the UK, a bunch of vote-seeking non-smoking puritans decided that our smoking ban should be extended.\u00a0 And like all power-crazed maniacs, I can&#8217;t help feel that they haven&#8217;t looked at the long term effects of their actions.<\/p>\n<p>Some bright spark informed an underling to slap a &#8216;No Smoking&#8217; sign on the door to the entrance of the communal stairway of my flats.\u00a0 And it says, &#8216;It is against the law to smoke in the common areas of this premises&#8217;.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Now, at a guess, I&#8217;d say that this sticker must have cost around 2p to produce.\u00a0 Multiply that by the amount of flats in England, and that&#8217;s going to work out to a heap of cash &#8211; a waste of cash in fact.\u00a0 I have, on occasions, lit up in this stairwell while talking to my neighbour,\u00a0who also smokes. \u00a0And despite this act of\u00a0&#8216;not giving a shit&#8217;, neither of us has been arrested by the &#8216;Smoke Police&#8217;!<\/p>\n<p>The ban here began with a no smoking policy on all forms of public transport, and I can live with that.\u00a0 Not even I want to sit in a carriage full of smoke.\u00a0 Then the ban was aimed squarely at the pubs, clubs and restaurant, and other public places of entertainment.\u00a0\u00a0 Fine, I can understand and deal with that too.\u00a0 Still, it\u00a0is a shame to see all those pubs close down, especially in our current financial trend.\u00a0 You would have thought that Government would be grateful of the extra revenue.\u00a0 Still, they know best I suppose!!!\u00a0 However, the way the &#8216;fresh air freaks&#8217; are heading now; you&#8217;ll\u00a0get banged up for smoking in front of your cat!<\/p>\n<p>So, here&#8217;s the latest list concocted by the &#8216;Anti-smokers Nazi League&#8217;, and as you might have guessed, it&#8217;s just getting sillier&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a specialist tobacconist, as of the 9\/3\/11, you will be <strong>forced\u00a0<\/strong>to rip out your shop front and replace your clear windows with frosted ones.\u00a0 The reason &#8211; so that your wears are out of view\u00a0of the public.\u00a0 Well slap my thighs with a bee&#8217;s tabard, all the privacy an armed robber needs to turn the place over!\u00a0 Initially,\u00a0smoked glass was to be used, but it was deemed to unhealthy\u00a0for flies.<\/p>\n<p>In April 2012, all supermarkets will <strong>have<\/strong>\u00a0to remove their cigarette cabinet and place the contents under the counter.\u00a0 And in 2015, all of the smaller shops <strong>must <\/strong>follow suit.\u00a0 This would make cigarettes the &#8216;new porn&#8217; surely?<\/p>\n<p>And the next stage well, this really is a piece of work.\u00a0 Every scrape of recognisable packaging is to be removed, leaving you with a plain packet.\u00a0 Top marks!\u00a0 No printing costs equals cheaper cigarettes!!!\u00a0 There may be a little bit of aggravation ordering your stock but, never the less, well done.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t no about you, but I am a tad pissed off with these faces arses, who earn more money than I&#8217;ll see in a lifetime, telling me how to live my life.\u00a0 I see no plans to drive the wine and Bollinger brigade under the counter, despite the fact alcohol\u00a0causes as many, if not more, problems as cigarettes!<\/p>\n<p>Get this, the cheeky bastards.\u00a0 A survey undertaken by another bunch of invisibles profoundly stated that it was the lower classes who smoke more, which obviously make <strong>us<\/strong> their problem!\u00a0 What a bloody surprise!\u00a0 Who&#8217;s first in line\u00a0for the chop when a firm goes under?\u00a0 The guys on the bench.\u00a0 Can we sit back, safe in the knowledge our mortgage payment can be met, and wait to be head-hunted?\u00a0 No!<\/p>\n<p>If these\u00a0so-called well educated people\u00a0think they&#8217;ve got a problem with funding hospitals now, imagine how surprised they&#8217;ll be when the next wave of mental health patients starts queuing up in about nine months time.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>They could, of course, address the problem of illegal substances.\u00a0 Oh no, hang on, that&#8217;s to difficult police isn&#8217;t it!\u00a0 &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s have a pop at something we can <strong>control<\/strong>, because we know exactly where the suppliers are.\u00a0 Bang out of order.\u00a0 There&#8217;s no doubt, that this scheme will backfire on the Government, and here&#8217;s why&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>The unemployment figures will rise to an epidemic proportion never before\u00a0seen in the UK.\u00a0 Already &#8216;Beep, Beep Bloody Beep&#8217; Ltd, a London based smoke alarm factory, has closed down with a loss of 200 jobs.\u00a0 Less fires &#8211; no need\u00a0 for smoke\u00a0detectors.\u00a0 And, the knock-on effect of this will result in job losses throughout the Fire Brigade service.\u00a0 Already\u00a0firemen have begun setting fires just to give them something to do.\u00a0 And what will they do when Guy Fawkes is banned?\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>All Catholic priest will be banned from swinging their incense\u00a0burners about, in a bid to eliminate the chances that tobacco might have been added surreptitiously.\u00a0 And now the &#8216;Smoke Nazis&#8217; are investigating third hand smoke.\u00a0 And if they can prove it&#8217;s as harmful as second hand smoke, all crematoriums will be closed down forthwith, fifthwith in some cases!<\/p>\n<p>Then of course, as if they haven&#8217;t had a hard enough time of it already, the nation&#8217;s fishermen and wet fish shop owners\u00a0will face a new problem.\u00a0 Oh yes, you can kiss goodbye to smoked haddock, mackeral, salmon, trout, and\u00a0herrings and kippers madam, far to dangerous!<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0Police force and Army\u00a0will have to restock part of\u00a0their arsenal of weapons with\u00a0Smoke Bomb &#8216;lights&#8217;.\u00a0 Tear gas, however is perfectly fine.\u00a0 And the ban is set to hit the drinks industry for a second time, as Smokey Bacon Crisps will be withdrawn as they may be a danger to children.<\/p>\n<p>Working in a nuclear plant is quite safe\u00a0apparently, but you can&#8217;t smoke inside one, as it may give you cancer!!!\u00a0 And finally, and most\u00a0critically, you will be hung for smoking at a windswept\u00a0bus stop\u00a0shelter.\u00a0\u00a0However, step one pace to the left or right of the wind tunnel, and you will be perfectly within the law of the land&#8230;<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a
