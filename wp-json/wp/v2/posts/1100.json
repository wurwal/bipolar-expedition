It\u2019s just as well he did.\u00a0 I was on a downer and very confused. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go and see your doctor,\u201d he asked.\u00a0 \u201cWould you come with me?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cYeah, no problem.\u201d He replied.\u00a0 I think because I heard the word doctor, I recall asking him if he could drive as slowly as he could.\u00a0 I think it was because I was in no rush to go back in the \u2018fun palace.\u2019\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Doctor Gibbon had opened the surgery on this Saturday afternoon to see me personally.\u00a0 Now that\u2019s what I call a National Heath Service.\u00a0 I was in such a state of confusion, apparently, that when she asked a question I drifted off mentally.\u00a0 I can vaguely remember mumbling away to myself as I sat cross-legged on the doctor\u2019s couch.<\/p>\n<p>She gave me a large red tablet to take.\u00a0 This was to stop me getting any higher throughout the rest of the day.\u00a0 She also gave Bill a second tablet in a brown envelope for me to take at 9.00 p.m. that evening.\u00a0 Bill said he would make sure I took it.\u00a0 The whole week-end felt surreal, even more so after taking the medication.\u00a0 What a result, my doctor\u2019s being open on a Saturday!\u00a0 I really was a punnet short of a strawberry that day.\u00a0 Doctor Gibbon asked me if there was anything else I needed or wanted.<\/p>\n<p>I thought for a moment, this being the only question I actually understood, and said, \u201cWell, I could do with, a good, hard, shag.\u201d\u00a0 In complete control and with only a hint of a smile she replied, \u201cI\u2019m afraid we don\u2019t that on the N.H.S.\u201d\u00a0 At the time I was totally oblivious as to just how funny that must have sounded. \u00a0Months later Bill reminded me of what I had said and we fell about laughing.\u00a0 It was nice to know that I still had the ability to make people laugh.<\/p>\n<p>I lost the rest of Saturday and the majority of Sunday to the powerful medication I was given.\u00a0 Bill contacted my Mum to explain what had happened at the surgery.\u00a0 She was back on my door-step the very next day.\u00a0 I had completely lost the plot this time.\u00a0 For reasons best known to me I decided to put some of my tools in the washing machine and turn it on.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Can you imagine the noise!\u00a0 God knows how long they were in there clanking around before Mum switched it off.\u00a0 I, of course, was totally oblivious to the row, thanks to the high I was on.\u00a0 From what I can gather, the best way to describe how I acting was to watch a four year old child at play.<\/p>\n<p>As usual I had lost all concept of time, and was totally reliant on other people.\u00a0 It\u2019s a wonder I didn&#8217;t start a fire, as I smoke.\u00a0 I guess I had a taste of what some people would like to experience again, a second child-hood.\u00a0 It\u2019s a shame I can\u2019t remember more of those seventy-two hours, perhaps its better I can\u2019t.\u00a0 I sometimes wish, when I hit a low spot, the whole twelve years of my illness had been like that lost weekend.\u00a0 As it is, I will remain mentally scared for the rest of my life.<\/p>\n<p>I awoke with a start early on Monday morning after having a nightmare.\u00a0 I had dreamt that I saw my Mum was dying.\u00a0 She looked surprised to see me presenting her with a cup of tea but I wasn&#8217;t to know it was half-past-five in the morning.\u00a0 I gave a sigh of relief to see my little Mum was still breathing.\u00a0 The next twelve hours were hectic to say the least.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Prior to Mums\u2019 arrival I had become obsessed with colour co-ordinating my clothes, all of which I separated to those of the armed forces, from khaki through to navy blue.\u00a0 I put the trousers on hangers followed by the shirts and then their jackets.\u00a0 Any other tops or T-shirts that were left over I rolled up as you would a flag and placed them on a work-top next to the kitchen sink. \u00a0At this point everything had to be spotlessly clean and tidy; I also polished all of my shoes and boots, putting clean socks in each pair.<\/p>\n<p>I had stumbled into another fantasy, now believing that whatever colour top I had on in the morning was the service I had secretly been drafted into.\u00a0 If I saw someone in the street with a similar colour scheme as mine they were also in the same force.\u00a0 Because this would have been a hush-hush operation, I was left to guess as to what rank the other people held.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>On this one particular day I had put on a white T- shirt and a pair of navy blue jogging bottoms. I was convinced I was a Naval rating who had been granted shore leave.\u00a0 So where would I go with my imaginary forty-eight hour pass?\u00a0 That\u2019s right, the nearest grog shop.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Days earlier I had finger-knitted a wrist-band made from white string.\u00a0 This was something my dad had taught me to do as a boy.\u00a0 Basically, it was a means of shortening a length of rope. I just adapted it for my own purposes.\u00a0 I tore off a segment from a matchbox and wrapped it around a solitary match.\u00a0 Then I poked it through the plaited twine.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>As I pulled the wrist-band back into shape the string gripped my make-shift source of ignition.\u00a0 With this in place I turned the band around so the match and its wrapping faced my wrist and just touched the palm of my hand.<\/p>\n<p>My reason for this elaborate process was obvious, but of course only to me.\u00a0 Although I was on shore-leave it occurred to me that I may be called upon to do a four-hour watch, well you would wouldn\u2019t you?\u00a0 Christ knows where of course, the nearest ship was bloody miles away.\u00a0 Still you never know somebody might have gone down with scurvy on HMS Belfast!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Anyway I wasn\u2019t going out without a fag on me, so I tucked one behind my ear. I was in a world of my own, where it seemed my subconscious had overridden my conscious mind.\u00a0 I can\u2019t even remember where my Mum was before I went walk-about.\u00a0 I do however recall my personality changing from a serious mood to a jovial one and back again, as if someone had flicked a light-switch on.<\/p>\n<p>At this juncture my imaginary furlough began to merge with a new fantasy. \u00a0In my head, clear as a bell, I heard the voice of Paul McKenna the hypnotist. \u00a0I was now under his control, something that was to occur again.\u00a0 Not only could I hear him, I could even feel the weight of his arm through mine as he led me into the car park of the flats where I lived.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHold up,\u201d I said, \u201cwhere are we going?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cOh, just a little stroll,\u201d he replied smugly.\u00a0 \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to go for a walk thanks.\u201d I said in disbelief. \u201cWell just try and stop yourself then,\u201d he answered with a chortle.<\/p>\n<p>So I tried to turn round, my upper body moved but my feet were firmly stuck to the pavement.\u00a0 The fantasy hypnosis was incredibly powerful.\u00a0 Try as I might I couldn&#8217;t break free from its grip.\u00a0 I heard Paul say, \u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019ll give you a sporting chance.\u00a0 After the count of three I\u2019ll release your feet, ready, one\u2026 two\u2026 three\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Part four next week&#8230;<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a
