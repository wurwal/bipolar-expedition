smoke without Fuhrer (part II)"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Well now it&#8217;s just\u00a0getting\u00a0plain silly.\u00a0\u00a0What used to sound like, neee-narrr, neee-narrr\u00a0will now sound like, pufff-cofff pufff-cofff, and you&#8217;ll find your house\u00a0has\u00a0been surrounded\u00a0by the\u00a0Smoke Police!\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I received a letter from my landlord some months back, which informed me that I could no longer smoke in my communal entrance and stairwell but, I could still smoke in my flat.\u00a0 Oh grow up!\u00a0 If you take it too its literal meaning, I can be fined for lighting up\u00a0in the stairwell, but not if I&#8217;m standing\u00a0at my front door blowing smoke out into the communal space!\u00a0 And don&#8217;t get me started on the bus stop malarkey!<\/p>\n<p>Oh yes, wait until we&#8217;re all hooked on the stuff, and then start moving the goalposts, very smug\u00a0right around election time.\u00a0\u00a0Even though I smoke, like a smoker who has just\u00a0been informed that last years tobacco crop has failed, I do take into consideration where I am and who is near me when I smoke.\u00a0 I agreed when the top deck of a bus was a made a\u00a0 smoke free zone.\u00a0 I was also glad when my addiction was banned on the tubes, although it wasn&#8217;t banned for\u00a0personal health reasons, it was banned because of the\u00a0fire risk (quite handy though wasn&#8217;t it).\u00a0\u00a0However, when the ban reached the pub circuit I had to stick my oar in, because I\u00a0had a vivid picture of what was to come.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Have we <strong>all<\/strong> sat around the table, and by we, I mean the smokers and\u00a0non smokers, the NHS\u00a0and the tobacco companies, to deal with this situation?\u00a0 If we have, I don&#8217;t remember the lengthy debate or being invited.\u00a0 Go on, ban\u00a0smoking entirely, I dare you, and let&#8217;s see how much you&#8217;ve got left in the Government coffers at the end of the first year!\u00a0 And while you&#8217;re at it, let&#8217;s ban alcohol too! \u00a0I agree smoking\u00a0is\u00a0bad\u00a0for your health, but there must be a fairer way of resolving this.\u00a0 Perhaps\u00a0the\u00a0tobacco companies\u00a0would like to make a donation to the NHS, on a regular basis, to aid finding a cure for lung cancer!\u00a0 After all, it&#8217;s their product that is mostly\u00a0blamed for this\u00a0disease.<\/p>\n<p>Did I signed up for\u00a0the bonus chemicals when I started smoking?\u00a0 No!\u00a0\u00a0Was I informed about them on the packet?\u00a0 No,\u00a0 not until about a decade ago.\u00a0 Is the packet large enough to print the entire\u00a0contents of tobacco on?\u00a0 Doubt it!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All\u00a0I want is the nicotine.\u00a0\u00a0We&#8217;ve\u00a0gone\u00a0from a\u00a0second hand smoke tactic, to a third hand smoke scare tactic, and at that point I was waiting for a news flash telling me that I couldn&#8217;t\u00a0smoke in front of my cats!\u00a0\u00a0 The next plan is to ban smoking in your vehicle, the one you paid for!\u00a0 And this will come with the message that it&#8217;s just one more place where your\u00a0kiddy-winks can inhale your smoke.\u00a0 Now hang about, what about all that bonus\u00a0carbon monoxide that&#8217;s floating about when the kids walk to school or are out playing?\u00a0 \u00a0And what about the toxic\u00a0fumes caused by industry?\u00a0 You wait, the next thing the smoker will be blamed for is global warming, I&#8217;d put money on it.\u00a0 Now,\u00a0obviously I&#8217;ve thought long and hard about what&#8217;s coming next!\u00a0 So here it comes&#8230;\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>If the\u00a0Smoke Police are given more power, things are going to look like this in the future:\u00a0all crematoria will be closed down.\u00a0 Well, that&#8217;s a ninety-a-day habit right there.\u00a0 All working chimneys will be detained under the, &#8216;I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s gone far act&#8217;, of 2012.\u00a0 \u00a0And you can forget all about burning mad cows &#8211; from now on\u00a0they will have to be boiled.\u00a0 Naughty volcanoes will be arrested on site\u00a0if they so much as cough,\u00a0and, bloody and now then, Fireman will only be able to attend a blaze if\u00a0smoke is present.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Moving swiftly on, you won&#8217;t be able to buy smoked ham, trout and sausages, herring or salmon either.\u00a0 And you can forget all about smokey bacon crisps too!\u00a0 All of Mr. Robinson&#8217;s record covers will have to be reprinted.\u00a0 Deep Purple&#8217;s hit will just be called, On the Water,\u00a0from now on,\u00a0and you won&#8217;t be able to get a copy of Smoke gets in your Eyes, for love nor money!\u00a0\u00a0And what about the\u00a0cost to industry?\u00a0 Smoke detectors will have nothing to detect and will be made redundant.\u00a0\u00a0Bespoke tailors will have to remove certain items in their range, leaving the customer with no choice but to buy just,\u00a0a jacket!\u00a0 So there you go&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Right I&#8217;m off, I got two free tickets to see Lock, Stock and Two Barrels<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a
