They were like coke bottle ends and were set in a pair of thick dark frames.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>He also wore a scruffy black jacket, a bright green shirt, and around his neck was a brown tie.\u00a0 Judie and I were well into two solid minutes of laughter, and character assassination, when suddenly she looked over my shoulder and then fell silent.\u00a0 Her jaw dropped wide open and she had a vacant look on her face.<\/p>\n<p>While I was still chuckling I heard a squeaky voice say behind me, \u201cExcuse me have you seen my photos?\u201d\u00a0 When I spun round, the bloke we\u2019d just been barracking was standing in front of us!\u00a0 It was a tad embarrassing I have to say, and I still had the photo sheet in my hand.\u00a0 He must have heard us giggling like a pair of school kids beforehand so, acting like one; I shoved the sheet in my bag!<\/p>\n<p>While we were both still cackling, we had to listen to a long drawn- out saga of how two days prior he\u2019d used the photo booth, but nothing came out.\u00a0 I never did discover how Judie stopped herself from completely.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Me?\u00a0 I adopted the, biting the inside of my mouth approach, and as much clenching as my facial muscles would allow, before cramp set in.\u00a0 How I didn&#8217;t hit the deck slapping the tarmac, begging him to stop talking, I don\u2019t know and, when I realised he was wearing the same clothes as in the picture, I had to walk away\u2026<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a
