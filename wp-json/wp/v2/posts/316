department.\u00a0 Well my British chums, this does seem to be the case, but who&#8217;s to blame?\u00a0 Well that&#8217;s still under discussion over here.\u00a0\u00a0Mr Brown is blaming the yanks.\u00a0 The yanks are blaming the oiks in the sub-prime market,\u00a0who couldn&#8217;t pony up the dough for their mortgages, when the price of gas and food went through the roof.\u00a0 Now, call me old fashioned, but why did the prices go up in the first place, moreover, where did the problem really\u00a0begin?\u00a0 Pull up a petunia and I&#8217;ll give my version of the events.\u00a0 Please set your visual receptors to radical.<\/p>\n<p>Bush\u00a0and Blair decided to look for weapons of mass destruction (WMD),\u00a0in a land far, far away that just happened to have an inordinate amount of crude oil.\u00a0 Did they find any WMD?\u00a0 No, in brief,\u00a0not even the bloke in\u00a0local tourist information\u00a0kiosk could help them.\u00a0 Did\u00a0they pop over to Iraq to grab some free crude?\u00a0 Well, I&#8217;ll leave that up to you to decide.\u00a0 Did\u00a0Bush and Blair upset any of the other members of OPEC?\u00a0\u00a0Oooh you bet your\u00a0bippy they did!\u00a0 Wallop!\u00a0 Up went the price of sweet crude.\u00a0 It was priced at $80\u00a0a barrel\u00a0at the time, then, surprise surprise, six months later a barrel of &#8216;go-juice&#8217; topped out at\u00a0$153.\u00a0 The knock-on effect, of course, was that\u00a0the\u00a0cost of all things transported went up too, three in some cases.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And it wasn&#8217;t\u00a0long before the inflated prices were past on to the masses.<\/p>\n<p>The timing was perfect for the\u00a0 stock market\u00a0to step in and secure the latest\u00a0recession.\u00a0 The &#8216;buy, sell, dollar, Mark&#8217; brigade, in my humble opinion, they\u00a0should be hung, drawn and quartered and then hung again.\u00a0 In all intents and purposes it&#8217;s a &#8216;money for old rope&#8217; job.\u00a0 I wouldn&#8217;t mind so much, but the money isn&#8217;t theirs, and come to think of it, neither is the rope!\u00a0 Let&#8217;s take the futures market for example, what a plum career that is.\u00a0 Shit, I could do that job lying in bed!\u00a0 If I&#8217;d have known, when I left school that\u00a0you could apply for a job guessing for a living, I would&#8217;ve taken it!\u00a0 I\u00a0looked on a job search site last week in fact, but\u00a0I didn&#8217;t see a single\u00a0advert\u00a0saying, WANTED &#8211;\u00a0ONE OMNIPOTENT.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>While the banks are in a state of panic, the reliable British Post Office has reintroduced\u00a0four old accounts that were used by millions of UK residence\u00a0during the 40&#8217;s and 50&#8217;s.\u00a0 The Under the floorboard account, the Mattress account, and the Shoebox account.\u00a0 If you&#8217;re all ready using the popular, Shoebox\u00a0&amp; Mattress\u00a0combined account, you&#8217;ll reap the\u00a0benefits of a 3% bonus at Christmas, which will then be taxed at 4% in the New Year.<\/p>\n<p>So, who&#8217;s going to bail out the people who have had their pensions reduced, their income slashed, and now can&#8217;t afford to\u00a0pay their mortgages because they&#8217;re unemployed?\u00a0 That&#8217;s right, you and me, the &#8216;little&#8217; people, the ones who can least afford it, and haven&#8217;t got a\u00a0bloody clue how we got in this state in the first place!\u00a0 In banking terms this is called, the fungi effect.\u00a0 The clients are\u00a0kept in the dark, for months at time, and crapped on twice a day.\u00a0 As plebs our job is to pull together so we can save the careers of the higher echelons of our great city.\u00a0 Two bank\u00a0mangers have already handed in their resignations, but don&#8217;t fret,\u00a0they won&#8217;t\u00a0have to go through the\u00a0depressing act\u00a0of signing on or losing the their <strong>homes\u00a0<\/strong>and<strong>\u00a0cars, <\/strong>because they were due to retire in four days anyway.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>So how can we help the poor rich?\u00a0 Well for a start you can begin by having a good root around at the back of\u00a0 our sofas and armchairs, slash open the material at the back\u00a0if you have to.\u00a0\u00a0Empty your child&#8217;s piggy bank, and send the contents, however small, straight to a stock broker.\u00a0 You may have one living in your street.\u00a0 If so, just tip what you&#8217;ve found through their letterbox. \u00a0Next, rally your friends, and see if anyone is willing to retire at the age of\u00a0106.\u00a0 The extra tax will come in handy.\u00a0 You could write to the BBC and suggest that Blue Peter starts an appeal, and if you could cancel Christmas that will be a great help too.\u00a0 The\u00a0cash you&#8217;ve saved can be posted directly to the stock exchange.\u00a0\u00a0 And finally, petition your local MP, and ask for a fresh air tax can be introduced.\u00a0 Once a FAT has been implemented all UK nationals <strong>except<\/strong>: Royalty, people who think they&#8217;re Royalty, tennis club members (much the same thing), Lords and\u00a0MP&#8217;s and all of\u00a0their relatives, and of course,\u00a0 the stock brokers,\u00a0will be fitted with an oxygen cylinder and pay-as-you- go meter, and if you can&#8217;t keep up the payments,\u00a0well I&#8217;m sure you get the picture.<\/p>\n<p>Part two of,\u00a0Letters from home\u00a0will include: who else could help if they wanted to?\u00a0 And,\u00a0new currency\u00a0for the plebs.\u00a0\u00a0 And in part three I&#8217;ll take a\u00a0look at, new currency for the stinking rich.\u00a0 What about the interest on my\u00a0 account?\u00a0\u00a0 Where will my\u00a0new bank be? (plebs only)\u00a0 And, where will my bank be if I&#8217;m loaded?<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a
