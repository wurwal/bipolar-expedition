To this day I don&#8217;t know how we used to get any work done, as\u00a0we seemed to spend most of the time annoying the tea lady&#8217;s, laughing, and winding up the boys in the firm.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The place was known as &#8216;The Mad House&#8217; by anyone who worked there, and it was the scene of many a silly situation.\u00a0 This particular\u00a0episode\u00a0 concerns\u00a0one of lads in the office.\u00a0 He came a cropper when he walked into the plate making department one\u00a0day, at a time when the work had dropped off, and the plate makers were bored&#8230;\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The apprentices were our main targets for japes and entertainment when the work dropped off, but the boys in the office weren&#8217;t immune from the windups, ritual verbal abuse and the odd light beating.\u00a0 Some were afraid to walk through the proofing department, and one kid left the day after joining the firm as I believe the first words he heard from one of the proofers was, &#8220;I&#8217;ve shagged yer mum, and yer dad,&#8221;\u00a0and he followed it up with, &#8220;You haven&#8217;t got a sister &#8216;ave you?&#8221;\u00a0 Another boy filled his shoes a week later, and the proofers jumped on him, posing a mock query on a job spec.\u00a0 A client wanted a bunch of special colours to wrap around his biscuit tin, so they asked\u00a0the\u00a0fresh lamb to pop along to see our ever jovial store man, to see if the tartan ink had been delivered!\u00a0 He arrived, job bag in hand, only to be to, &#8220;Fuck off, and stop asking stupid bloody\u00a0questions.&#8221;\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The next day he was walking through my department, when a workmate noticed his brightly coloured tie.\u00a0 He engaged him in a futile conversation and then said to me, &#8220;&#8216;ere Neil, look at that tie, I bet you wouldn&#8217;t cut in half.&#8221;\u00a0 I said, &#8220;How much?&#8221;\u00a0 &#8220;Thruppence,&#8221; came the reply.\u00a0 &#8220;Done,&#8221; I said, and with that I\u00a0snipped it in two with my scissors.\u00a0 Witnessing that clothing wasn&#8217;t a barrier to us, the office boyss came up with a new survival technique to get them through the day.\u00a0 A few would exit the firm and re-enter at another point, just to bypass the proofers and plate makers.\u00a0 Others would feign leg injures or death\u00a0to drop someone else in it, rather than face the walk of certain ridicule themselves.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Come the morning of &#8216;The Great Soaking&#8217; the plate makers were in fine fettle.\u00a0 The work had eased off, and it was playtime, where quite honestly anything could happen.\u00a0 Our Irish tea lady copped the first wave of inane banter, and she was now in charge of going out for our mid-morning grub.\u00a0 This was the woman that came into the firm one day complaining\u00a0that her feet hurt; when we looked down we saw that she had her boots on the wrong feet!\u00a0 As usual, she already had a certain amount of dubious request on her list.\u00a0 Item one was a whelk yogurt, and from the bakers she was asked if she could get a fresh pie, a bun cup and two pregnant tarts!\u00a0 Anyway, as she was doing\u00a0the rounds in our department one of the office boys drifted in, and as he was walking past one of our sinks, our foreman, Mick\u00a0asked if he would fill it up.\u00a0 He put the plug in, turned on the tap, and began searching through our job rack looking for a bag of films.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>At this point I should explain that our sinks were a tad larger then your average household fitting, quite a lot larger actually.\u00a0 A six foot man would&#8217;ve had no trouble in\u00a0lying flat out in one, with his arms and legs spread open.\u00a0 He could also have had\u00a0a bath if he wanted too, as they were roughly two feet deep.\u00a0 Well, our victim had been rifling through the job rack for 15 minutes or more, and he eventually found what he was looking for, and he was just about to return to the office when Mick asked him to turn the tap off for him.\u00a0 Then he made a fatal mistake.\u00a0 He asked our foreman if there was anything else he wanted him to do before he disappeared.\u00a0 &#8220;Well, get in of course,&#8221; Mick replied.\u00a0 There was a sort of stunned silence, followed by a look of impending doom about his face when he realised what department he was in.\u00a0 Then, in a fit of peak, he made a break for the door, the door that somebody had locked quite recently!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>He put up a hell of a struggle for someone of his slight stature and weight, but overall he was only ever going one place before making his way back to the safety of the office.\u00a0 Splash he went; soaked from head to foot, an excellent way to start the day off.\u00a0 He\u00a0gave up in the end of course, and ended up laughing his face off, we grabbed him some overalls, and a coat from the stores, and someone lent him a pair of trainers.\u00a0 He dried himself off, and eventually made it back to the office in his new attire.\u00a0 Just over an hour later he returned with a\u00a0jubilant smile of acceptance on his face, and he&#8217;d come back to\u00a0check on his clothes, which were drying off in the boiler room.\u00a0 His shirt, boxers and socks were nearly wearable, but his jeans and shoes were still way off being dry.\u00a0 He still had a good few hours to go before clocking off, but he was concerned about his shoes, so one of our apprentices said he&#8217;d spend some time blowing warm air into them using one of our plate driers, which was just like a big hair drier.\u00a0 He seemed happy with that and went on his way.<\/p>\n<p>An hour before knocking off, Martin returned to see if his strides were ready to wear, but they weren&#8217;t.\u00a0 The legs were almost dry, but the waist band, the pockets and parts of the seat of his jeans were still damp.\u00a0 As he was beginning to look despondent, and I didn&#8217;t want to see him upset further, I said he might as well\u00a0put them in out plate oven to speed up the process.\u00a0 What I didn&#8217;t know, because I&#8217;d been working in another part of the firm for most of the afternoon,\u00a0was that the oven had been on for most of the day.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>We used to bake some of our plates as it gave the images on them\u00a0a longer life when they were used for long print runs for jobs like Dulux paint tins.\u00a0 I felt the side of the oven and, although it was still hot, it was starting to cool down, so I hooked his jeans onto one of the oven racks, slide it in and closed the door.\u00a0 I told Martin to come back in 15 minutes, so he wondered off, and I picked up another job from the rack.\u00a0 Another key factor that I wasn&#8217;t aware of was that the oven, which was electric, had only just been turned off.\u00a0 Worse still\u00a0it was cooling down from a temperature of 700 degrees &#8211; whoops!<\/p>\n<p>The time slipped by, as it does when you&#8217;ve got your head buried in your work, and I&#8217;d completely forgotten about what was simmering in the oven.\u00a0 Suddenly, a frantic office boy burst\u00a0back into my department, with a worried look on his face, as he knew he was\u00a0five minutes later than he should have been.\u00a0 Now having the attention of the whole plate making staff, I un-clipped the oven door and pulled out the rack with a pair of heavy-duty heat resistant gloves.\u00a0\u00a0At first glance you couldn&#8217;t help but notice that something wasn&#8217;t quite as it should have been.\u00a0 My co-workers reinforced this observation by collapsing, one by one, over their workbenches.\u00a0 The jeans entered the oven with the dark blue colour usually associated with this apparel.\u00a0 However, on their exit from Satan&#8217;s sandwich maker they were now an unhealthy shade of brown.\u00a0 &#8220;Well,&#8221; I said with straight face, &#8220;at least they seem to be dry now.&#8221;\u00a0 The whole floor burst out laughing.\u00a0 Martin looked at me, and then at his well cooked jeans in total disbelief.\u00a0 Gingerly he touched one of the legs with the tip of a solitary forefinger,\u00a0and then watched as they\u00a0disintegrated into dust on the floor before him.\u00a0 It was just\u00a0like watching a clip form a Tommy and Jerry cartoon&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>No apprentices were harmed in the production of this episode.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>All material is under copyright.<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('\/outgoing\/delicious.com\/post?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbipolar-expedition.local%2Fdry-cleaning-printers-style%2F&amp;title=Dry+cleaning+%E2%80%93+Printers+Style');\"  rel='nofollow'  target='_blank'  title='Bookmark this post : Dry cleaning &#8211;
