the very people we send it back to, the water board!\u00a0 Why do we give them money every month and what the hell are spending it in?\u00a0 Oh sure, they clean it up and sell back to us, but you\u2019d think by now someone would take a look at all the leaking pipes.\u00a0 But no, they&#8217;ve let it slide and now there\u2019s a shortage.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Can we retrieve it?\u00a0 No!\u00a0 In fact you&#8217;ve got more chance of squeezing a hippo\u2019s arse in a Butler sink mate!\u00a0 It\u2019s gone never to return, seeped deep below into the water table or its evaporated back into the atmosphere.\u00a0 Don\u2019t worry though; the government has issued a statement and a plan to easy the situation.\u00a0 Next Tuesday the whole of the UK\u2019s residence will be forced to take part in a sponsored 12 hour rain dance.\u00a0 Call me old fashioned, but if water was gas there wouldn&#8217;t be any leaks.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone who wishes to sign up to &#8216;Forward&#8217;\u00a0the bipolar newsletter I write for can do so by sending a blank email to <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('\/mailto\/ashby300@hotmail.com');\"  href=\"mailto:ashby300@hotmail.com\">ashby300@hotmail.com<\/a>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Just put the word \u2018subscribe\u2019 in the subject box at that it.\u00a0 We cover bipolar and other mental health\u00a0news stories from around the globe.\u00a0\u00a0We\u00a0also\u00a0have a humour section and it\u2019s a free publication.<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('\/outgoing\/delicious.com\/post?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbipolar-expedition.local%2Fwater-water-everywhere-not-anymore%2F&amp;title=Water%2C+water+everywhere+%E2%80%93+not+anymore');\"  rel='nofollow'  target='_blank'  title='Bookmark this post : Water, water everywhere &#8211;
