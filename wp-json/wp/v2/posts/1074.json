In the crease of my left arm I had a bigger target and no visible tendons.\u00a0 All I had to do now was push the blade in.\u00a0 I stabbed either side of the vein.\u00a0 Forty-eight hours later I was still deliberating about my attempted suicide.<\/p>\n<p>I heard the third dawn chorus &#8211; you wouldn&#8217;t believe the row those bloody birds made first thing in the morning.\u00a0 My next stop was going to be my garage, quiet and dark all the time &#8211; perfect.\u00a0 I guess I had it in mind to starve my self to death.\u00a0\u00a0If that were the case why was I contemplating taking bottles of water with me?\u00a0 Probably to keep my mouth and throat lubricated as I am a heavy smoker.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>So, with a supply of H20 and as many fags as I could carry, this being my only source of nutrition in the last seventy-two hours, the next task would have been to haul the mattress off of my bed and dump it in the garage.\u00a0 But I was so weak I couldn&#8217;t shift it off the bed.\u00a0 Let alone pull it down two flights of stairs and drag it across the car park.\u00a0 It has been said that to take your life is the coward\u2019s way out.\u00a0 Yeah, bollocks it is!<\/p>\n<p>What caused my suicide attempt was a catalogue of disasters one after another over a three-year period.\u00a0 They plunged me slowly and painfully into clinical depression.\u00a0 I was powerless to stop it and the last person to know I was ill.<\/p>\n<p>After three days I eventually answered the door.\u00a0 It was Bill, a close friend and school mate of mine. \u201cWe\u2019ve been concerned about you mate, so has your Mum, nobody has heard from you in a while, we just wondered if you were all right?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cYeah, sorry mate,\u201d I replied.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m okay, I just feel a bit tired that\u2019s all apart from that I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u00a0 I tried to make small talk to mask my real feelings but Bill saw through this like a glass book.<\/p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t keep up the pretence any longer.\u00a0 The smile disappeared from my face and my head fell forward into my hands.\u00a0 I showed him my arm.\u00a0 \u201cWhy am I doing this to myself Bill?\u201d\u00a0 He was very calm about the situation.\u00a0 \u201cYou&#8217;ve had a lot of stress in the last three years, things that were out of your control. Basically it\u2019s affected your health.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Bill\u2019s mother-in-law had been in the nursing profession for over twenty years and saw my break-down coming.\u00a0 It was she who advised Bill on how to help me I later found out.\u00a0 The advice was simple.\u00a0 Without too much fuss, get Neil to his doctor, he is suffering from clinical depression.\u00a0 Bill\u2019s words to me were, \u201cI think we should make a trip to the quacks, what do you reckon?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI know I\u2019m not a hundred percent,\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0I said, \u201cbut is it really that serious?\u201d\u00a0 He just shut his eyes and nodded a couple of times.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Pre-empting my answer Bill had already phoned my GP &#8211; they were just waiting for us to arrive.\u00a0 \u201cCould you take me?\u201d I asked.\u00a0 \u201cThe car\u2019s outside mate,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cWhat, today? \u2026\u00a0\u00a0 What, now?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWhen you\u2019re ready,\u201d he replied.<\/p>\n<p>Bill was the sort of friend you could trust with your life.\u00a0 For him to be worried about me I knew I had to put my faith, what was left of it, in his judgement.\u00a0 I made another pot of tea, the British thing to do in a situation like this.\u00a0 I sat down to let the information sink in, not realising just how life-altering this visit to the doctor\u2019s was going to be.<\/p>\n<p>When we arrived at the surgery the receptionist showed us straight into my doctor\u2019s room.\u00a0 She asked me some questions relating to diet, sleep pattern and motivation. \u00a0My reply to all three was just one word, \u201cPoor.\u201d\u00a0 The final question from my doctor, knowing in my heart it was rhetorical, was the hardest, shortest and the most painful I have ever had to answer.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>There was a terrible, sickening silence after she said the words \u201cHave you tried to harm yourself in anyway?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cYes,\u201d I said quietly. \u00a0After that I don\u2019t remember speaking any more.\u00a0 I was mentally exhausted and overwhelmed with emotion.\u00a0 I had to let Bill take over the proceedings.\u00a0 He asked my GP what the next step was.\u00a0 Doctor Gibbon replied, \u201cI think it would be best for Neil to see Dr. Gadhvi, the head psychiatrist at Claybury Hospital.\u00a0 I have made an appointment for Neil to see him this afternoon.\u00a0 I need a second opinion.\u00a0 Based on his report Neil may have to go into hospital for a short time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Things were moving too quickly for me, with talk of head shrinks and hospitals, but I was in no fit state to argue.\u00a0 I was swept along with the tide after that. \u00a0This was starting to feel like a sad episode of \u201cCasualty\u201d come to life.\u00a0 Karen Gibbon was a kind, caring and considerate person.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>She made sure I understood what was going on, without belittling me, emphasising that a stay in hospital would be probable, after my consultation with the other doctor.\u00a0 Family and friends had carefully planned my path towards hospital; the trip to the trick-cyclist was a mere formality.<\/p>\n<p>After visiting Dr Gadhvi my fate was secured.\u00a0 I fell silent again.\u00a0 This was too much to cope with.\u00a0 Bill took over as my ears, eyes and brain.\u00a0 At the end of the consultation it was decided that I would go in hospital as a voluntary patient for a minimum of two weeks.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Technically I was sectioned under the Mental Health Act, but I was informed I could leave the hospital any time I liked.\u00a0 Bill asked the doctor when this would happen and was told, \u201cThere will be a bed ready for him tonight.\u00a0 Perhaps this afternoon you could help Neil pack a bag,\u201d Bill nodded in agreement.\u00a0 Christ, what do I pack?\u00a0 I&#8217;ve never been in hospital before, let alone a nut house.\u00a0 What the fuck is it going to be like in there?\u00a0 Of course I had a vivid picture in my mind, who wouldn&#8217;t?\u00a0 At this point I was petrified and powerless.<\/p>\n<p>This was another situation that was totally out of my control.\u00a0 My life was now in other people&#8217;s hands.\u00a0 I didn&#8217;t like it one little bit.\u00a0 Bill was still on hand for support, and later that evening he ferried me to the hospital.\u00a0 It was only a short ride, but I remained quiet for hours as I remember.\u00a0 Communication was down to hearing and nodding only.\u00a0 I didn&#8217;t have the strength for anything else.<\/p>\n<p>Part three next week&#8230;<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul
