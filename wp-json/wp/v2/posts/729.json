never had it so good"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Now, as far back as I can remember there has always been some form of equality for women\u00a0in the British Isles.\u00a0 It might have been as well balanced as the &#8216;little&#8217; lady liked, but at the bare minimum\u00a0you would have a door opened for you on occasions&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>In the fifties, mummy was brain-washed into believing that she had to do everything for her man, because that&#8217;s what the generation before did.\u00a0 Thankfully, I&#8217;m glad say, that attitude has changed however, a certain faction of the female lady-partners will insist on moaning about their life-style choices, their partners eventually and why they haven&#8217;t got enough shoes,\u00a0and more often that not it&#8217;s the male partner who cops the flak&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>So, I appeal to the chaps to contact me with regard to this annoyance, and I will personally\u00a0arrange a trip for any\u00a0 nagging trouts, old and young, to see if I can help the nagees, and give the naggers something to think about.\u00a0 And I thought I&#8217;d start with a\u00a0six month break\u00a0in Saudi Arabia, where they will live the life of\u00a0a Saudi wife, just to see how they get on.<\/p>\n<p>Now the first subject that may cause our British ladies some problems\u00a0is the religious side of life.\u00a0 Most serious out there, and\u00a0largely in favour of the lads I feel.\u00a0 And, perhaps this\u00a0is due to the fact\u00a0that the Saudi book of &#8216; This is how it&#8217;s\u00a0gonna be&#8217;\u00a0was alledgedley\u00a0written by a bloke, much like our &#8216;rule book&#8217; of life.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>But you know, I can&#8217;t recall seeing a clause in the C of E\u00a0handbook where it states that: men are superior to women and are commanded to beat their wives if they are disobedient.\u00a0 Moreover, when I went to Sunday school, (that&#8217;s attended, not forced to attended), I\u00a0don&#8217;t remember our teacher saying that\u00a0it would be absolutely\u00a0tip-top\u00a0to have\u00a0as much rumpy-pumpy as I liked, with all of\u00a0my wives and concubines, when I grew up.<\/p>\n<p>Call me old fashioned, but it seems to me as if the rules change for the blokey-bloke-about-town depending on what country\u00a0he happens to have\u00a0been born in!\u00a0 Okay, I was born in England, and maybe I am a bit of a softy, I really don&#8217;t\u00a0give a toss.\u00a0 At least I&#8217;m not a sexist pig who thinks he can control, beat and debase women just because a rather old book says I can.\u00a0 Maybe, just maybe, these books should be updated, after all, EVERYTHING needs updating at some point\u00a0doesn&#8217;t it!<\/p>\n<p>In these far of lands, will your daughter be able to gain an education?\u00a0 WHAT!\u00a0\u00a0Why would you need one, when you have a bunch of men to tell you what to do for the rest of you natural life.\u00a0 That&#8217;s assuming you tow the line and don&#8217;t get executed in the process.\u00a0 In any case, you can&#8217;t go around being smarter than a man, what would his mates think?\u00a0 I mean Jesus, if the ladies start thinking for themselves\u00a0they&#8217;ll want to start driving cars on the strength of that!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Worse still &#8211; they might want to get a job!\u00a0 Fuck that for a game of soldiers!\u00a0 What ever next &#8211;\u00a0conversations with\u00a0men outside their family, while they&#8217;re\u00a0completely unattended by a man from a man inside their family circle!!!\u00a0 Good God, the whole fabric of society would break down.\u00a0 No, no,\u00a0I can see why you would need a strict rule to hid behind, especially if you wanted to suppress one section of the population, do what you like\u00a0and have sex on tap.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s consider the breaking of rules for a moment.\u00a0 That too seems to fall heavily to one side, the female side you maybe surprised to hear!\u00a0 You may have just gone out to hang up the washing in the garden, you know, stepped out side of your house.\u00a0 But did you ask for permission, more importantly, did you ask a man?\u00a0 No!\u00a0 Oh deary, deary me!\u00a0 Well, let&#8217;s see what it says in the &#8216;good book&#8217; about that&#8230; no, before we start delving into how to\u00a0recieve a damn good &#8216;scourging&#8217;\u00a0(Flailed)\u00a0by your loving hubby, let&#8217;s take a look at the punishment for the children.<\/p>\n<p>Now I don&#8217;t care what background you&#8217;ve come from or how much money you&#8217;ve got in the bank, everyone during their formative years has nicked something, even if it was for a dare.\u00a0 So how do you deal with this?\u00a0 Well, every parent has a different approach depending on the details of this petty crime.\u00a0 My dad gave me a damn stiff taking too, and that was enough to put me off a life of pilfering.\u00a0 Let&#8217;s take in\u00a0a few facts from the book of &#8216;This is how it&#8217;s gonna be&#8217;.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Not only do the laws state that women are not just second class citizens, half a man, at times their very exsistence is disregarded.\u00a0 And someone pointed out that the ladies of Saudi have managed\u00a0 to achieve equality in one field only: equal rights to imprisonment, exile, torture, being killed and now slaughter.\u00a0 Well there you are, things are really moving forward now!!!\u00a0 Is that, &#8220;I will survive,&#8221; playing in the background&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>In the\u00a0children&#8217;s department it seems that being punished, suddenly the more mature the female is, the more responsible they are for their actions.\u00a0 Overall, less rights, more punishment &#8211; nice!\u00a0 So, if you\u00a0can imaging a scenario where a boy of 14 and a girl of 9 stole an item, here&#8217;s how it would pan out.\u00a0 According to the laws the girl would lose four fingers on her right hand for a first offence.\u00a0 On a second offence her left foot would be cut off, she would go to prison for a third offence and\u00a0on a\u00a0fourth occasion she would be executed!\u00a0 Possibly a tad harsh. \u00a0The boy, on the other hand, with the\u00a0missing digits,\u00a0would go Scott free.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Sounds like a great place to live &#8211; if you&#8217;re a bloke&#8230;\u00a0 Still think your life&#8217;s crap?<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a
