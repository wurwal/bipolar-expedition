Mum had always lived a long way from her sister, Rene, since they both married.\u00a0 After a lifetime of parenting and work she deserved to do what she wanted for a change.<\/p>\n<p>When she went it was awful.\u00a0 Mum, Dad and the family home had been in the same place for twenty-eight years.\u00a0 I lived in that house from the age of four. I had moved out a few times, as did my sister, but I always had a secure base if anything went wrong.\u00a0 I know Mum was racked with guilt for months after moving, and I did try to alleviate some of her worry, but all the same I felt as though I had lost an arm and a leg in the same day.<\/p>\n<p>I\u00a0carried on taking my medication, but after a while it didn&#8217;t seemed to be doing much good.\u00a0 A new drug had just hit the market and my GP thought it might help my mood &#8211; <em>it was called Prozac<\/em>.\u00a0 I can see now why it was called \u2018the sunshine drug.\u2019\u00a0 I took one capsule and by the next morning I couldn&#8217;t stop smiling.\u00a0 It worked as quickly as E.C.T., only without the storming headache that followed each session.\u00a0 I felt so good I began drinking again, every night for six months.<\/p>\n<p>By that time I thought I had escaped the clutches of my depression. \u00a0I was firing on all cylinders, with both oars in the water, head facing forwards at last, and it was legal!\u00a0 However, this falsehood was to cause major problems in the coming months. \u00a0I was heading for a bout of powerful psychotic highs.\u00a0 I wasn&#8217;t overly confident to begin with, but as the weeks passed I remember feeling pumped all of the time, and up for anything.\u00a0 My razor sharp wit had returned and I was making people laugh.\u00a0 Everybody around me thought I was back to my old self.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to my redundancies, and on Bill\u2019s advice, I had taken out an insurance policy that protected my mortgage against unemployment and illness. \u00a0More importantly it covered mental illness.\u00a0 Bill acted on my behalf when the time came.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t think that the company would pay out such a vast sum of money per month without a fight, even though I fitted the policy\u2019s requirement to the letter. \u00a0Bill made the call and I sat with bated breath waiting to hear their technical cop-out clause.<\/p>\n<p>Call me pessimistic but I was right.\u00a0 I checked the small print in the pamphlet and couldn&#8217;t spot it, neither could Bill. \u00a0He looked through the policy under a microscope and found the problem in the fine print, where else.\u00a0 The clause stated that I had to have paid a minimum of six months\u2019 subscriptions from a source in my profession before my claim could be validated.\u00a0 This excluded benefit payments.\u00a0 I had made four monthly payments when I was working and two payments from my benefits.<\/p>\n<p>Seron said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019ll think of something.\u201d\u00a0 Bill went quiet for a good ten minutes; lifting up his head he said with a smile, \u201cGot it!\u201d\u00a0 It was true to say that I had only made four of the six payments.\u00a0 All that was checkable from the date on my benefit claim form.\u00a0 But not only was I receiving state benefits, I was also entitled to gratuity from my union\u2019s unemployment fund. \u00a0Therefore I had been paid a sum of money from my trade of work six months in a row.\u00a0 The policy didn&#8217;t state a specific amount, but I can bet it does now.\u00a0 Bill got on the phone and relayed his findings.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>After a while the guy on the other end realised that he had been painted into a corner by the better man.\u00a0 \u201cYou can relax now,\u201d Bill said putting down the receiver \u201cYou\u2019re covered for 12 months; the beers are on you I think.\u201d\u00a0 I planted a kiss on his forehead and told him what a star he was, mentioning that if he and Seron wanted another child, I would have it for them minus the conception part!<\/p>\n<p>I went for a few interviews prior to the usual fight for my benefits and eventually I took a job in a family-run print firm near the Barbican.\u00a0 After the spaciousness of D. S. Colour I was about to find out that size really does matter.\u00a0 My new department was situated below ground level and right next door to the machine room.\u00a0 I have never worked in a room that had it own weather system before!\u00a0 It was hot, dusty and noisy in the summer and damp, dusty and noisy during the winter months.\u00a0 More importantly there was no access for natural daylight, all of which didn\u2019t affect me to begin with.<\/p>\n<p>The room itself measured approximately 18\u2019 x 12\u2019 x 10\u2019, which sounds a fair size until you put two people in it and all of the printing equipment.\u00a0 We had a large camera that we used to copy base artworks from.\u00a0 This had two powerful lamps on it and was situated in a 6 x 4 darkroom.\u00a0 Just outside of the sweat box was a printing down frame.\u00a0 This consisted of a 3 x 4 rubber backed base with a glass top.\u00a0 Underneath was a vacuum; this held the films and plates in a fixed position.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Over head was an artificial ark lamp; this exposed our film images to the printing plates.\u00a0 Just to add a little extra warmth to the hamsters\u2019 maze we had the bonus of the firms\u2019 boiler pipes just above our heads.\u00a0 On a good month we could grow cucumbers! \u00a0I had been used to working in a large open-plan room with at least eight people.\u00a0 Here, if you didn&#8217;t get on with the person you were working with you were stuffed; there was nowhere else to go.\u00a0 After ten months of working in the rat run, the non-conducive atmosphere was beginning to take its toll on my health.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>My new work chum didn&#8217;t have the same sense of humour as I did, which was a problem for me. \u00a0Soon after I started my new job he told me he was the boss\u2019s son.\u00a0 This news unfortunately reached me three days too late.\u00a0 In the pub after my first day, a member of the office staff asked me what I thought of the place.\u00a0 Having said what I had said I don\u2019t think I had told them anything they didn&#8217;t already know. I replied, \u201cIt\u2019s dingy, cramped and to fucking hot, and the wages are crap as well, but it beats signing on.\u201d\u00a0 Up the workers!\u00a0 You can\u2019t blame a bloke for telling it like it is!\u00a0 Dad would have been proud of me.<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a
