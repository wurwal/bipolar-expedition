unemployed drivers"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>They are, without doubt, the biggest bunch of money grabbing bastards since the UK&#8217;s\u00a0tax systems were invent.\u00a0 They ply their trade openly across this green and pleasant land and their main weapon of drumming up trade is to prey on the human fear of loss.\u00a0 Naturally, I\u2019m talking about this country\u2019s car insurers&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p>They are raking in thousands of pounds a day and are quite happy to pay out on a claim, as long as you don\u2019t mind if your premium goes up when you do!\u00a0 And now they\u2019re persecuting the unemployed driver.\u00a0 My only question is; how the hell are they getting away with it?\u00a0 Here\u2019s an explanation from an arse inside the British Insurances Brokers\u2019 Association. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u2018Unemployed people\u00a0are viewed as less likely to maintain their vehicles and as higher credit risks.\u2019\u00a0 He went on to say, \u2018Insurers might also have concerns over what their vehicles would be used for and whether they would be used more often.\u2019 \u00a0[You mean people are actually driving their cars &#8211; on the roads &#8211; OMG!!!]<\/p>\n<p>And cop this from the AA.\u00a0 \u2018The unemployed are more likely to be distracted because of their circumstances, likely to be driving along unfamiliar roads and \u00a0\u00a0attempting to find specific addresses in search of job interviews.\u2019\u00a0 Priceless!\u00a0 Well I think someone should exert more pressure on the person who\u2019s been cast aside from their employer, but how?\u00a0 Ooh, I know, let\u2019s hike up their premium by 40%.\u00a0 This happed to one driver and it\u2019s an absolutely despicable practice.<\/p>\n<p>Another caring insurance Nazi said, \u2018The long-term unemployed were more likely to be claimants than those just out of work, and their financial circumstances were seen as more likely to lead them to make fraudulent claims.\u2019\u00a0 Oh I see, so what they\u2019re doing is ripping off the soft targets first, rather than shelling money to catch the few.\u00a0 It makes you wonder what the\u00a0\u00a0 insurers\u00a0next move will be, house insurance possibly. \u00a0\u00a0Can you imaging the scene?\u00a0 I\u2019ll help you out.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u2018Do you leave your house outside madam?\u2019\u00a0 \u2018Err, yes.\u2019\u00a0 \u2018Ooh that&#8217;s going to be expensive, is it valuable?\u2019 \u2018Well yes.\u2019\u00a0 \u2018Does it have windows and doors?\u2019\u00a0 \u2018Ummm, no!\u2019\u00a0 \u2018Is it a tent?\u2019\u00a0 \u2018Is a tent cheap to insure?\u2019\u00a0 \u2018Yes.\u2019\u00a0 \u2018Well yes, it\u2019s a tent then.\u2019\u00a0 \u2018Okay, let me just look at the risks, will you leave your tent outside and does it have window and door flaps?\u2019\u00a0 And so it goes on\u2026\u00a0 I wouldn\u2019t mind if insurers based the risks on actual human claims.\u00a0 Instead they use a method called actuarial science, which uses Mathematics and statistics for calculations.<\/p>\n<p>My answer &#8211; since we don\u2019t have a crash everyday, why should we pay for insurance every day?\u00a0 Think of it like the lottery\u2026<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a
