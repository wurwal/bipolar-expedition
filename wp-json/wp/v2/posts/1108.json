I could have slapped him. \u00a0I wouldn&#8217;t have asked if I wasn&#8217;t desperate.\u00a0 Perhaps I didn&#8217;t look desperate enough.<\/p>\n<p>My eternal pub triangle or the reason for being there, what ever that was, now had no sides to it.\u00a0 No cigarettes and no money equalled no beer.\u00a0 This stage of the afternoon had just hit the boring zone.\u00a0 There was no doubt in my mind that I had to re-evaluate my position.\u00a0 For a start, the wonderful Mr McKenna had buggered off without a trace.\u00a0 No hint of a kiss my arse, goodbye, nothing.<\/p>\n<p>I couldn\u2019t ask the barman if he could see an invisible film crew, he was giving me funny looks as it was.\u00a0 Why was I here anyway?\u00a0 This was beginning to feel like a bad joke at my expense.\u00a0 I felt a floating sensation wash over me and things didn\u2019t seem so bad.\u00a0 I walk over to the fruit machine and put my penny in the slot. \u00a0Through my eyes at least it looked as though I had won the \u00a320 jackpot. \u00a0Beer and cigarettes flashed from my brain&#8217;s memory department like a May Day call.<\/p>\n<p>I pushed the collect button but something was missing.\u00a0 It was the old familiar sound of clanky bits of loose change hitting the pay out tray. \u00a0I looked back up at the screen to see my winnings had vanished.\u00a0 This was turning out to be, \u2018one of those days.\u2019 This is something that still happens to me today but thankfully not so frequently.\u00a0 I have learnt to cope with the start of feeling high.<\/p>\n<p>I run through a mental checklist:\u00a0 Have I missed my medication?\u00a0 Have I eaten?\u00a0 When did I last have a beer?\u00a0 When my mouth is working thirty six times faster than my brain, it\u2019s time to sit down and eat something.\u00a0 Half an hour later my blood\u2019s sugar level has balanced out. \u00a0My smoking pattern slows down and my caffeine consumption is drastically reduced.\u00a0 Then instead of doing seven things at once, I return to the tried and tested method of, one thing at a time.<\/p>\n<p>I retrieved my coin from the reject slot and took a seat next to a bearded man who was parked on a bench seat near the fire.\u00a0 I asked him if he could spare me some wedge for half a Guinness.\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t do the drink,\u201d he answered, \u201cbut your more than welcome to a roll-up.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cOh cheers mate; you\u2019re a life-saver.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>By now I was getting that uneasy feeling you get when you know people are starring at you.\u00a0 So I walked to the end of the bar where there were no customers.\u00a0 I sat on a bar stool wondering what to do next.\u00a0 Oddly enough, the thought of going home didn&#8217;t enter my head.<\/p>\n<p>As I looked behind the bar I noticed some long stemmed champagne glasses above the optics.\u00a0 They had been arranged like a coconut shy but I didn\u2019t have a ball, well not as such.\u00a0 Although I was on an abnormal high I was still able to judge distance and height.\u00a0 My grey matter was sifting information, albeit over a trivial task. I was too close to the glass target area to throw my intended missile. \u00a0Somehow for, reasons best known to myself, I was intent on making up a challenge.\u00a0 My prize, a single shot at the glass coconut shy.<\/p>\n<p>I placed my penny on the floor just behind the bar stool.\u00a0 Then I hooked both of my feet under the foot rail that circled the bar.\u00a0 Sitting in an upright position, I leant over backwards to see if I could pick up the coin.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>It was surprisingly easy, now for the real test of strength; could I pull myself back up?\u00a0 I felt every muscle in my torso tense up and the blood was pounding around my head.\u00a0 With my feet still anchored, I raised my body back up to the bar in one slow, meticulous movement.\u00a0 I have to say I had impressed myself with my abdominal power.\u00a0 Now it was time to pick up my prize.<\/p>\n<p>Part 5\u00a0next week&#8230;<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li
