and all because I trusted the words that come out of my then\u00a0\u00a0partners mouths.\u00a0 If there was an, &#8216;I&#8217;ve changed my mind&#8217; or a, &#8216;Jesus, you&#8217;re too ill&#8217;,\u00a0clause I wouldn&#8217;t have bloody bothered.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>As you know, if you\u00a0believe all of\u00a0the claims that are made about a product\u00a0in\u00a0a TV\u00a0advert, you&#8217;re either under\u00a0five years old or\u00a0very, very mental.\u00a0\u00a0If you can&#8217;t understand\u00a0why something that you spent\u00a0a tenner on,\u00a0breaks the minute you take it out of the box, even though it has a lifetime guarantee,\u00a0you shouldn&#8217;t be allowed in shops on your own or given money until you&#8217;re 47 and a half!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few\u00a0pointers\u00a0to look\u00a0for when you&#8217;re trying to avoid being caught in a quandary\u00a0over\u00a0whether to trust a person or a situation.\u00a0\u00a0Eyes are a dead give away obviously, especially if they are to close together.\u00a0\u00a0Also, never trust a person without earlobes!\u00a0 A certain percentage of people\u00a0are born with ears that join their faces, from\u00a0top to bottom, and this\u00a0birth defect, known as the &#8216;Stuck on effect&#8217;\u00a0 leaves\u00a0the victim\u00a0totally\u00a0lobe-less.\u00a0 Over time, this condition\u00a0goes onto affect their mental state, and in the end, they try using a marker pen or Biro to give their ears some definition.\u00a0 When this fails, they begin lying to everyone they know, and\u00a0eventually\u00a0become estate agents.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Mechanics and builders are also keen trust breakers, some even have a PhD in the subject.\u00a0 A universal phrase to listen out for is, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be &#8216;onest wiv ya.&#8221;\u00a0 If you hear this repeated more than\u00a0three times in a verbal exchange, dismiss them immediately, and ask a close friend to recommend someone they have used in the past.\u00a0 &#8220;Should be ready on Tuesday,&#8221; is another key statement to be wary of.\u00a0\u00a0People with unusually small moustaches should also be avoided, look at the very, very, naughty\u00a0Hitler for example.\u00a0 He told\u00a0the German nation that\u00a0 they would win the\u00a0Second World War, ladies and gentlemen, he was talking out of his poo-shoot!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand,\u00a0our fine upstanding and more importantly, honest, Winston Churchill said, &#8220;Never have so many, done so much, with so little, by so few, to people so far away.&#8221;\u00a0 And he was right!\u00a0 The country trusted him to come up with the solutions to end the war with the Bosch, and when it was all over they kicked him out of No. 10!\u00a0\u00a0So you see, even politicians can get it wrong sometimes.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Always, always avoid people with no necks, with the exception of Clive Anderson of course, mainly because of his rapier like\u00a0wit.\u00a0\u00a0Every time I&#8217;ve had dealings with the &#8216;no neck&#8217; society I&#8217;ve been let down.\u00a0 The leader of the BNP,\u00a0Nick Griffin &#8211; no neck.\u00a0 I wouldn&#8217;t trust him as far as I could vomit.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Almost all of the\u00a0Argentinian nation are a bit short in the neck department, look at that footballer, Teves who plays for Man. City!\u00a0 Very little neck, but you&#8217;ll notice that he does have a seemingly endless supply\u00a0of\u00a0extra teeth to compensate.\u00a0\u00a0If you see an\u00a0Argentinian in the street, don&#8217;t wait for them to open their mouth,\u00a0 just shout out, &#8220;Watch out, watch out, there&#8217;s a\u00a0Arggy about,&#8221; and runaway.\u00a0 \u00a0Never enter a lift with a\u00a0Argentinian in it.\u00a0 Not only with you be lied to in a foreign language, you&#8217;ll die through lack of oxygen, as all foreigners speak much, much,\u00a0much, much\u00a0faster than us\u00a0proud,\u00a0educated and\u00a0non bigoted Britons!<\/p>\n<p>Name check: CNN News correspondent.\u00a0 Diane Swonk.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Right I&#8217;m off, but remember this&#8230; \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Marriage &#8211; it is just one simple word.\u00a0\u00a0However, it could so easily become\u00a0a lengthy sentence.<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li
