I was off and\u00a0 headed straight for the locked ward door&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Once outside and past the reception, I threw the keys into a mass of bushes and proceeded to stroll down the half-mile road which led to the main gates of the \u2018Fun factory\u2019.\u00a0 On reaching the entrance I had a quick shufti to find that, so far, I hadn\u2019t been followed and when I looked over the road there was a site to behold &#8211; a pub.<\/p>\n<p>Ambling into the car park I noticed a\u00a0black London\u00a0cab and\u00a0the drivers\u2019 door slightly ajar.\u00a0 The temptation to climb in and mess about with the instrumentation on the dash board was far stronger than my medication.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>After much pushing, touching and fiddling I got out and made my way to the pub door.\u00a0 I may have been mental and heavily medicated, but I still had a few \u2018normal\u2019 marbles left in reserve.\u00a0 So, to satisfy my worst fear, I touched the pub\u2019s brickwork just\u00a0to check it wasn\u2019t a mirage, nope it was rock solid.<\/p>\n<p>It must have been near closing time, as I could see the staff clearing up.\u00a0 Undeterred, I entered my oasis and ordered a pint of Guinness.\u00a0 As the barman placed it on the bar I said, \u201cCan I owe you for that, only I haven\u2019t got any money on me at the moment.\u201d\u00a0 By the look on the bar steward\u2019s face I could see he wasn\u2019t too pleased with my request.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>As quickly as he poured it, the accommodating sod chucked the pint down the sink.\u00a0 Six weeks without a beer had made tetchy, so, gutted by his unfriendly nature, I left the bar and\u00a0decided to stir things up in the car park.<\/p>\n<p>I spied a brand new 4&#215;4 Land Rover and thought I would test out its suspension.\u00a0 For a short time I jumped up and down on the running board on the drivers\u2019 side.\u00a0 After a while this\u00a0felt a bit tame, so I climbed onto the roof via a small ladder on the back of the vehicle and had a proper bounce about.\u00a0 Oh yes, this was much more aesthetically pleasing.\u00a0 At this point of the proceedings, a gin sodden old bint stuck her head out of an upstairs window.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Her opening gambit was most unbecoming of a lady, and in true fishwife style she hurled a volley of abuse at me.\u00a0 I must have answered her back, but for the life of me I can\u2019t remember what I said, more&#8217;s the pity.\u00a0 I presumed that this ravishing, Gordon\u2019s gin\u00a0blue-eyed beauty queen, 1947-1987, was the landlord\u2019s wife, poor bugger.<\/p>\n<p>Jesus it was a state.\u00a0 She had a face like a clear plastic bag full of crushed walnuts which had been ravaged by time and alcohol.\u00a0 I was soon joined in the car park by the publican and his young son, to the shriek of, \u201cLook Bert, he\u2019s climbing all over our new Motor\u201d, spoken in a heavy cockney accent.\u00a0 I thought he was going to ask me in for a night-cap.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>But no, instead he was offering to rip off both of my arms and beat me to death with them.\u00a0 Some people just can\u2019t take a joke!\u00a0 Somebody must have phoned the hospital because a Ford Transit van pulled up and out stepped four familiar faces from N2\u2019s night-staff.<\/p>\n<p>I was \u2018helped\u2019 into the van and returned to the ward.\u00a0 I tried to do a runner from the main corridor but the nurses were all over me like a rash, and a bit later I was asked the whereabouts of the ward keys.\u00a0 I told them roughly where I&#8217;d aimed them, but the trouble was there were literally thousands of bushes in the grounds of the hospital.\u00a0 I said\u00a0they had more chance of setting up a threesome with a couple of novice nuns than retrieving the lost keys, but they would insist we searched for them.<\/p>\n<p>So off we trotted into the night with a couple of torches and hope in our hearts!\u00a0 After 20 minutes of fruitless scavenging through the undergrowth the search was abandoned.\u00a0 I was frog-marched back to a single bed side-room on my ward, restrained and injected.\u00a0\u00a0[Part II to follow]\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Adapted from chapter three of Bi Polar Expedition<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('\/outgoing\/delicious.com\/post?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbipolar-expedition.local%2Fyou-know-when-you-just-want-a-beer%2F&amp;title=You+know+when+you+just+want+a+beer%E2%80%A6');\"  rel='nofollow'  target='_blank'  title='Bookmark this post : You know when you just want a beer&#8230;
