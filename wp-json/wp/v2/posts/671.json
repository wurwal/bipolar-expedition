(2009\/08\/09)\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>There was once, and I can&#8217;t emphasise the word &#8216;once&#8217; enough, who thought he comprehended the workings and ways of the American bear, he wrote about them, filmed them and eventually camped out in their surroundings.\u00a0 He did it for years and gained much notoriety and some fame for his efforts.\u00a0 The notoriety pumped up his already inflated ego and the fame made him believe he was God-sent to be at one with the bears.\u00a0 What happened?\u00a0 Yip, they ate him!\u00a0 So with this in mind, here&#8217;s another story of brazen stupidity, and believe me, you couldn&#8217;t make\u00a0this up&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Born the son of a roughty-toughty mechanic, Ron wanted to be a ballet dancer, and\u00a0right there is where it all started to go wrong for Ron.\u00a0 His dad was hoping that his son would take over the family business one day.\u00a0 But no, instead of warming to the look of a grease monkey, he picked up a vat of grease paint, and headed off to France.\u00a0 Once there, he joined the Follies Bergere, where he starred as a nude dancer &#8211; ewwwwwwwwwww gross!<\/p>\n<p>When he hit 30 Ron knew that he had to hang up his tights, as lifting up twiglet-sized females all day can\u00a0play havoc with your knees.\u00a0 It was a sad day, but you know what performers are like, they just can&#8217;t bloody stop doing it can they.\u00a0 Give &#8217;em a crowd of no more than a couple pensioners and a goat and they&#8217;re off.\u00a0 All tits and teeth &#8211; it&#8217;s enough to make you puke.<\/p>\n<p>After months of not knowing what to do with himself, he hooked up with a childhood\u00a0sweetheart Joy, and between them they decided\u00a0it would be a great idea to train up big some\u00a0cats and perform with them, while avoiding a proper job altogether.\u00a0 This would\u00a0prove to be his, well another friend, and Joys downfall anyway.<\/p>\n<p>Well, they took the show on the road, with some success, but as time went on, they got more cats and needed another pair of hands.\u00a0 Enter a lithe and young Chuck.\u00a0 &#8220;Oooh, he was gorgeous,&#8221; said a very bi Ron, as\u00a0bi as a fox with in a tu-tu in fact, but never the less they went on to become a famous threesome, in every sense of the meaning.\u00a0 In came the cash, up went their status, and they went onto open an animal sanctuary.\u00a0 Yes folks, we&#8217;ve reached &#8216;that&#8217; part of the tale.<\/p>\n<p>[Before I go any further, I thought\u00a0I\u00a0should explain this crucial fact.\u00a0 Having an in-bred or a cross-bred cat causes major problems in the long run, largely in the eating department.\u00a0 If a lion mates with a tiger, for example, you end up with a beautiful, but confused offspring.\u00a0 Half of it wants to go for a swim, and the other half doesn&#8217;t.\u00a0\u00a0The result &#8211; one\u00a0pissed off\u00a0person-eater.]<\/p>\n<p>As with most shows, they\u00a0needed to be updated to keep the audiences\u00a0interest, and when the bookings dropped off, our chum Ron, in his buttock-hugging leather shorts said, &#8220;We just gotta get a white tiger.&#8221;\u00a0\u00a0Enter Jupiter.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Now, he was a gorgeous beast and no mistake, 600lbs of teeth and claws, but graceful with it.\u00a0 Chuck raised him and all was well initially.\u00a0 However, the fact of the matter is this, most white tigers are in-bred, and overall, this leaves you with a very large and unpredictable animal.\u00a0 Did Ronnie-baby know this fact?\u00a0 Well, yes he did.\u00a0 Did he care?\u00a0 I don&#8217;t think so.\u00a0 All\u00a0he wanted was the stardom and the\u00a0fame to continue, no matter what.\u00a0 Big mistake!\u00a0 Chuck tripped\u00a0over some equipment that was left lying about\u00a0one day, because they were having a new\u00a0new cage built.\u00a0 This startled Jupiter, and he jumped all over his trainer, leaving him permanently short of breath.\u00a0\u00a0<strong>Shock-horror-gasp<\/strong>!\u00a0\u00a0Man-eating animal eats man!!!<\/p>\n<p>At this point Joy stopped eating, became depressed and then suicidal, and in Ron&#8217;s own words, &#8220;She was praying to die, she didn&#8217;t know how\u00a0she was going to die, she just wanted to.&#8221;\u00a0 Well poor old Ron, two rutting partners down &#8211; one &#8216;brown bread&#8217; (slang: dead) and one who was suffering from acute melancholia, (the fear of cute melons).<\/p>\n<p>In a bid to rally the spirits of his ailing partner, he woke her up one night and asked her if she&#8217;d like to go and see the &#8216;babies&#8217;.\u00a0 Eventually, she prised herself up from her mattress, went to the fridge, picked up a few meaty tit-bits and followed Ron towards the cat enclosure.<\/p>\n<p>She handed a few piece of one dead animal to a larger living one and received a hug for her efforts, and then\u00a0Burt the tiger was led back into its pen.\u00a0 Overjoyed with the outcome , soppy bollocks brought back Jupiter, with the hope of the same success.\u00a0 Well, you know what life&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s got that nasty\u00a0habit of biting you right in the arse when you&#8217;re least expecting it.\u00a0 And unfortunately, Jupiter was a tad hungrier than everyone one thought, favouring a good sized\u00a0chunk out of Joy&#8217;s\u00a0neck, rather than a handful\u00a0prime rump.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>What did the surviving member of The Cat Dancers say to the huge in-bred beast, &#8220;What have you done to mom?&#8221;\u00a0 As he couldn&#8217;t speak yet, Jupiter began crying and sniveling, according to Ronald.\u00a0 No he wasn&#8217;t you prat, he was licking his lips and hoping for a plateful of dessert!<\/p>\n<p>So, what have learned from this ridiculous circle-world farce?\u00a0 Never, under any circumstances, let a bi-sexual ballet dancer\u00a0teach a classroom full of students about animal husbandry, never ever think that for one moment that you are a tigers parent, and if you do lose two dear shagging partners to one man-eating animal, at least you&#8217;ll get a nice big rug out of the deal if it all\u00a0does\u00a0go fun-bags upper most&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Right, I&#8217;m off to adopt a crocodile&#8230;cab&#8230;<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('\/outgoing\/delicious.com\/post?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbipolar-expedition.local%2Fpushmi-pullyu-eats-dr-dolittle-says-sun%2F&amp;title=Pushmi-pullyu+eats+Dr+Dolittle+%E2%80%93+says+Sun%21');\"  rel='nofollow'  target='_blank'  title='Bookmark this post : Pushmi-pullyu eats Dr Dolittle &#8211;
