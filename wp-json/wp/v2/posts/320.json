one.\u00a0 I mean, how much lottery\u00a0money\u00a0is sitting in a Swiss bank account right now?\u00a0 In layman&#8217;s terms, frigging millions mate!\u00a0 I understand that some of this has to used to pay the winners and help charity organisations, but,\u00a0 bloody but, what about the unclaimed cashy-wonga?\u00a0 The interest alone could be used to help the poorest people in the UK, the ones who can&#8217;t\u00a0pay their rent or buy\u00a0food because they&#8217;re spending way to much on lottery tickets\u00a0in the first place!\u00a0 &#8220;It could be you.&#8221;\u00a0 Yeah right!\u00a0 You&#8217;ve got\u00a0more chance of being stabbed by the Pope!<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the Queen could\u00a0flog off a couple of castles.\u00a0 After all, she can&#8217;t live in more than one at a time can she!\u00a0 If a &#8216;Twat tax&#8217; was introduced I believe that this\u00a0would rake in millions over the course of a year.\u00a0 Anyone who is deemed to be\u00a0a twat, by the Twat Board, will automatically lose 7.5% of their monthly income.\u00a0 The current contenders are:\u00a0all of the Big Brother contestants, and\u00a0everyone who the told the\u00a0early entrants of X\u00a0Factor they had a chance of winning.\u00a0 And lastly, and I realise this is a radical move, how about the tossers who gambled away the money in the stock exchange, after\u00a0a series of&#8217; bad guessing days?\u00a0\u00a0Extreme twats, such as this, should be forced to hand over their last bonus and fired, making sure that they never get another job in the money market again.\u00a0 Harsh, but fair, I feel.<\/p>\n<p><strong>New currency for the plebs. <\/strong>It&#8217;s obvious to me that a new currency has to be invented, and I&#8217;m glad to say that I have come up with an absolute winner.\u00a0 We survived for decades using pounds, shillings and pence (\u00a3sd), and then went metric.\u00a0 My\u00a0idea is no more radical than what&#8217;s gone before.\u00a0 My new monetary\u00a0system\u00a0 involves using\u00a0 woodland\u00a0animals, pets and insects,\u00a0instead of\u00a0paper money\u00a0and\u00a0 coins.\u00a0 In the long run this plan will save trees, halt the mining for metals, and\u00a0my plans for the new &#8216;super rich&#8217; currency will\u00a0go some way to saving some of the planets\u00a0 most endangered species in the future.\u00a0 No, no, there&#8217;s no need to thank me, I&#8217;m just glad to\u00a0help.\u00a0 The plans are thus:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step one<\/strong>: April 1st 2009.\u00a0 The\u00a0inhabitence of\u00a0the towns in\u00a0London should\u00a0all\u00a0meet outside their local\u00a0civic centre.\u00a0\u00a0 There,\u00a0they will be met by bank representatives, and asked to hand over every bit\u00a0of cash they can find in their homes.\u00a0\u00a0The total\u00a0will be added to their accounts, and their accounts will be closed, leaving the customer with a chit showing their current\u00a0 balance.\u00a0 <strong>Step two<\/strong>: once this procedure has taken place the customers with the chits will first receive a\u00a0course of Imodium, and then\u00a0led to conference room 1, where they will be able to pick up their\u00a0new currency.\u00a0 Here&#8217;s a break down of the new denominations.\u00a0 I&#8217;d just like to say that these took me minutes to devise and, as far as I can see, they are faultless!<\/p>\n<p>\u00a350 = 1 Badger\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a320 = 1 Fox\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a310 = 1 Whippet\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a35 = 1 Rabbit\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a31 = 1 Pigeon\u00a0\u00a0\u00a050p = 1 tit<\/p>\n<p>20p = 1 Toad\u00a0\u00a0 10p = 1 Frog\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05p = 1 Newt\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02p = 1 Earwig\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01p = 1 Gnat<\/p>\n<p>A monkey will still be worth \u00a3500 of course, and a pony will remain the same\u00a0at \u00a325.\u00a0 So let&#8217;s see how this breaks down in\u00a0todays prices using some basic essentials &#8211;\u00a0fags and beer.\u00a0\u00a0 (All prices correct from date of letter 27\/10\/08)\u00a0 A packet of Lambert &amp;

one whippet, four pigeons and four toads.\u00a0 You will need to buy a bigger wallet, and some larger trousers to hold any loose change but, apart from that, I can&#8217;t see a problem, accept\u00a0perhaps when it comes to using an ATM!\u00a0 Better make a note of that.<\/p>\n<p>Moving on, a\u00a0pint of Guinness, on average, costs \u00a33.20.\u00a0 This equates to: three pigeons and one frog, or six tits and\u00a0four newts.\u00a0 Hand over a rabbit and your change\u00a0could be, two tits and\u00a0four toads or variables thereof.\u00a0 And thanks to The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds stepping in as a sponsor for Harvester pubs, you will be able to collect pigeon and tit miles, or air miles as they used to be called.\u00a0 Okay, that&#8217;s enough information for now, but in the final part of, Letters from home, you will discover how much a Ferrari will set you back, and what a house might cost you if you choose to move to Holland Park.<\/p>\n<p>Right, I&#8217;m off.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve arranged a po-go championship for the patience at a local prolapse clinic&#8230;<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li class=\"iconOnly\"><a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('\/outgoing\/delicious.com\/post?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbipolar-expedition.local%2Fletters-from-home-part-two%2F&amp;title=Letters+from+home+%E2%80%93+part+two');\"  rel='nofollow'  target='_blank'  title='Bookmark this post : Letters from home &#8211;
