And what\u2019s the top prize for slogging your guts out on the French circuit for days at a time &#8211; a yellow T shirt &#8211; well slap my thighs and call me Susan,\u00a0 whoop-de-bleedin&#8217;-do!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>So, you want to buy a racing bike, and the equivalent of a male ballet\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 dancer\u2019s\u00a0outfit to impress the neighbours &#8211; how much do you think that\u2019s going to set you back?\u00a0 Well, the \u2018silly suit\u2019 alone has to be around \u00a3300 doesn&#8217;t it?\u00a0 Especially if the Lycra has been hand knitted by Chinese doves in Watford!\u00a0 And don\u2019t get me started on the rest of the rubbish\u00a0you think you might need.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Oh yes, the boys and girls in marketing have busted a gut to\u00a0relieve you of your wage packet, and you can you can pick up a \u2018speed demon\u2019 for a mere bagatelle, well if you call \u00a36,709 mere!\u00a0 With this price in mind, it doesn\u2019t take an idiot to work out how much the rest of the gear is going to cost. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0A bog standard helmet is \u00a328, but a racing version might cost \u00a3350.\u00a0 The list is endless and just the basic equipment will set you back \u00a32,000, and the pricing gets sillier and sillier depending on which country you\u2019re in.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In America, one bright spark set about building the world\u2019s most expensive two-wheeler, and you\u2019ll be glad to hear he succeeded.\u00a0 It\u2019s a snip at half a million bucks and it\u2019s so light you can lift it up of the floor with your wedding tackle!\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I mean, what was the fucking\u00a0thing made of for God\u2019s sake &#8211;\u00a0a range of last years butterfly&#8217;s knickers!\u00a0 I guess the first requirement is to find a rider that weighs less than a fetus.\u00a0 They would have to be that light to sit on a saddle no bigger than a matchbox for eight hour at a time. \u00a0And all for what?\u00a0 A brightly coloured piece of material and piles for the rest of your natural life.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Next week\u00a0tandems, and how they can be best used in a suicide bombing&#8230;<\/p>\n<div class='shareinpost'><ul class=\"socialwrap row\"><li
